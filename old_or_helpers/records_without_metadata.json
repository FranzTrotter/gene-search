    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics The clinical phenotype of alpha-mannosidosis varies considerably, with a wide spectrum of clinical findings and broad variability in individual presentation. At least three clinical types have been suggested in untreated individuals: mild (clinically recognized after age ten years, with myopathy, slow progression, and absence of skeletal abnormalities); moderate (clinically recognized before age ten years, with myopathy, slow progression, and presence of skeletal abnormalities); and severe (obvious progression leading to early death from primary central nervous system involvement or infection). Core features of untreated individuals generally include early childhood-onset non-progressive hearing loss, frequent infections due to immunodeficiency, rheumatologic symptoms (especially systemic lupus erythematosus), developmental delay / intellectual disability, low tone, ataxia, spastic paraplegia, psychiatric findings, bone disease (ranging from asymptomatic osteopenia to focal lytic or sclerotic lesions and osteonecrosis), gastrointestinal dysfunction (including diarrhea, swallowing issues/ aspiration, and enlarged liver and spleen), poor growth, eye issues (including tapetoretinal degeneration and optic nerve atrophy), cardiac complications in adults, and pulmonary issues (including parenchymal lung disease). However, with the advent of enzyme replacement therapy, the natural history of this condition may change. Long-term velmanase alfa (VA) treatment outcomes are still being elucidated, but may include improvement in hearing, immunologic profile, and quality of life (improved clinical outcomes for muscle strength). Similarly, affected individuals who underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) experienced improvement in development (with preservation of previously learned skills), ability to participate in activities of daily living, stabilization or improvement in skeletal abnormalities, and improvement in hearing ability, although expressive speech and hearing deficiencies remained the most significant clinical problems after HSCT.

Diagnosis/testing GeneReviews The diagnosis of alpha-mannosidosis is established in a proband by identification of deficiency of lysosomal enzyme acid alpha-mannosidase (typically 5%-10% of normal activity) in leukocytes or other nucleated cells AND/OR by the identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in MAN2B1 by molecular genetic testing. Management Targeted therapies: Velmanase alfa (Lamzede) enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) has been very well tolerated and is now regarded as a standard treatment for alpha-mannosidosis; improvement in both biochemical and functional parameters have been reported in treated individuals. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has been offered as a treatment for severe alpha-mannosidosis. While HSCT carries risks, the data suggests it is a feasible therapeutic option for alpha-mannosidosis, with better outcomes achieved by performing it early before complications arise, balancing the risks and benefits. Supportive care: Hearing aids may be helpful for those with sensorineural hearing loss, whereas pressure- equalizing tubes may be helpful for those with conductive hearing loss. Consider palmidronate (Aredia) monthly or zoledronic acid (Aclasta) once a year for osteoporosis or osteopenia. Standard treatment for immunodeficiency / recurrent infections, systemic lupus erythematosus, communicating hydrocephalus, ataxia/ gait abnormalities, poor weight gain / growth issues, eye/vision issues, cardiac valve dysfunction / dilated cardiomyopathy, recurrent chest infections / respiratory dysfunction, developmental delay / intellectual disability, and psychiatric manifestations. Surveillance: At each visit, measure weight, length/height, head circumference, and BMI; monitor growth pattern, developmental progress, and educational needs; assess for depression, including sleep disturbances, anxiety, &/or findings suggestive of psychosis; assess for new manifestations such as ataxia and gait abnormalities; evaluate for asthenia and signs/symptoms of communicating hydrocephalus; assess for muscle pain, joint aches, reduced range of motion, and bone pain; monitor for diarrhea and for size of the liver and spleen; and assess for the number and type of infections. Every six to 12 months in childhood and annually in adults, assess fine motor function, gross motor function, endurance, and muscle strength and tone by physical therapy; and assess for features of ataxia. Every one to two years, or as clinically indicated in those with hearing aids, perform an audiology evaluation. Every two to five years in children, adolescents, and adults, consider DXA bone densitometry scan to assess for osteopenia or osteoporosis; radiographs of the hips/spine may be indicated. Annually (or as clinically indicated), routine biochemical lab assessment to include liver and kidney health, blood glucose levels, fluid and electrolyte balance, and complete blood count (with platelets); consider immunlobulin levels, ESR and C-reactive protein; pulmonary function tests; and ophthalmology evaluation. At regular intervals based on clinical features, consider endocrinology evaluations, including hormonal and lipid profiles; consider assessment of liver and spleen size through ultrasound or MRI imaging; consider electrocardiogram, 24-hour electrocardiogram, and echocardiogram; consider sleep study. For those on ERT, plasma oligosaccharides to assess treatment response as clinically indicated. Post-HSCT evaluation of standard surveillance per hematologist/oncologist, which may include ongoing assessment for chimerism and enzyme activity if indicated. Evaluation of relatives at risk: Testing of all at-risk sibs of any age (including prenatal diagnosis) is warranted to allow for early diagnosis and targeted treatment of alpha-mannosidosis. Evaluations can include molecular genetic testing if the pathogenic variants in the family are known or assay of acid alpha-mannosidase enzyme activity in leukocytes or other nucleated cells if the pathogenic variants in the family are not known. 3 Genetic counseling Alpha-mannosidosis is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. At conception, each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Carrier testing for at-risk relatives is possible if the pathogenic variants in the family are known. Prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk is possible by assay of acid alpha- mannosidase enzymatic activity or molecular genetic testing once the pathogenic variants have been identified in the family."

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Alpha-thalassemia (-thalassemia) has two clinically significant forms: hemoglobin Bart hydrops fetalis (Hb Bart) syndrome (caused by deletion/inactivation of all four alpha globin [-globin] genes; --/--), and hemoglobin H (HbH) disease (most frequently caused by deletion/inactivation of three -globin genes;--/-). Hb Bart syndrome, the more severe form, is characterized by prenatal onset of generalized edema and pleural and pericardial effusions as a result of congestive heart failure induced by severe anemia. Extramedullary erythropoiesis, marked hepatosplenomegaly, and a massive placenta are common. Death usually occurs in the neonatal period. HbH disease has a broad phenotypic spectrum: although clinical features usually develop in the first years of life, HbH disease may not present until adulthood or may be diagnosed only during routine hematologic analysis in an asymptomatic individual. The majority of individuals have enlargement of the spleen (and less commonly of the liver), mild jaundice, and sometimes thalassemia-like bone changes. Individuals with HbH disease may develop gallstones and experience acute episodes of hemolysis in response to infections or exposure to oxidant drugs. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of Hb Bart syndrome is established in a fetus with characteristic hematologic and hemoglobin (Hb) findings and molecular genetic testing that identifies biallelic pathogenic variants in both HBA1 and HBA2 that result in deletion or inactivation of all four -globin alleles. The diagnosis of HbH disease is established in a proband with hematologic and Hb findings and molecular genetic testing that identifies biallelic pathogenic variants in HBA1 and HBA2 that result in deletion or inactivation of three -globin alleles.

Copyright 1993-2024, University of Washington, Seattle. GeneReviews is a registered trademark of the University of Washington, Seattle. All rights reserved. Management GeneReviews Treatment of manifestations: Hb Bart syndrome: intrauterine blood transfusions, improved transfusion strategies, and rarely curative hematopoietic stem cell transplant may allow survival of children. HbH disease: while most individuals are clinically well and survive without any treatment, occasional red blood cell transfusions may be needed during hemolytic or aplastic crises. Red blood cell transfusions are very rarely needed for severe anemia affecting cardiac function and erythroid expansion that results in severe bone changes and extramedullary erythropoiesis. In contrast, persons with non-deletional HbH disease may be more severely affected and transfusion dependent. Prevention of primary manifestations: Because of the severity of Hb Bart syndrome, the occasional presence of congenital anomalies, and the risk for maternal complications, prenatal testing and early termination of pregnancies at risk have usually been considered. However, recent advances in intrauterine and postnatal therapy have increased treatment options, thus complicating the ethical issues for health care providers and families facing an affected pregnancy. Prevention of secondary complications: Monitor individuals with HbH disease for hemolytic/aplastic crisis during febrile episodes; in those who require chronic red blood cell transfusions, iron chelation therapy should be instituted; for those who are not red blood cell transfusion dependent, iron chelation with deferasirox can be considered to reduce liver iron concentration. Surveillance: For HbH disease, hematologic evaluation every six to 12 months; assessment of growth and development in children every six to 12 months; monitoring of iron load with serum ferritin concentration and periodic quantitative measurement of liver iron concentration. Agents/circumstances to avoid: In persons with HbH disease: inappropriate iron therapy and oxidant drugs (i.e., the same drugs to be avoided by individuals with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency). Evaluation of relatives at risk: Test the sibs of a proband as soon as possible after birth for HbH disease so that monitoring can be instituted. Pregnancy management: Complications reported in pregnant women with HbH disease include worsening anemia, preeclampsia, congestive heart failure, and threatened miscarriage; monitoring for these issues during pregnancy is recommended. Genetic counseling Alpha-thalassemia is usually inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Hb Bart syndrome: At conception, each sib of a proband with Hb Bart syndrome has a 25% chance of having Hb Bart syndrome (e.g., --/--), a 50% chance of having -thalassemia trait with deletion or inactivation of two - globin genes in cis (e.g., --/), and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. HbH disease: The risk to sibs of a proband depends on genotype of the parents. Carrier testing: Family members, members of ethnic groups at risk, and gamete donors should be considered for carrier testing. Couples who are members of populations at risk for -thalassemia trait with a two-gene deletion in cis (--/) can be identified prior to pregnancy as being at risk of conceiving a fetus with Hb Bart syndrome. Prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing may be carried out for couples who are at high risk of having a fetus with Hb Bart syndrome or for a pregnancy in which one parent is a known -thalassemia carrier with a two- gene deletion in cis (--/) when the other parent is either unknown or unavailable for testing. 3"

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Individuals with aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) deficiency typically have complex symptoms, including motor, behavioral, cognitive, and autonomic findings. Symptom onset is in early infancy, typically within the first six months of life. The most common initial symptoms are often nonspecific, and include feeding difficulties, hypotonia, and developmental delay. More specific symptoms include oculogyric crises (which occur in the vast majority of affected individuals, typically starting in infancy), movement disorders (especially dystonia), and autonomic dysfunction (excessive sweating, temperature instability, ptosis, nasal congestion, hypoglycemic episodes). Sleep disturbance is present in a majority of affected individuals and can include insomnia, hypersomnia, or both. Mood disturbance, including irritability and anxiety, are also common. Brain MRI is typically either normal or may demonstrate nonspecific abnormalities, such as mild diffuse cerebral atrophy or delayed myelination. Seizures are an uncommon finding, occurring in fewer than 5% of affected individuals. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of AADC deficiency is established in a proband who has the following core diagnostic testing results: biallelic pathogenic variants in DDC identified by molecular genetic testing OR cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or plasma neurotransmitter profile consistent with AADC deficiency AND significantly reduced AADC enzyme activity in plasma.

Copyright 1993-2024, University of Washington, Seattle. GeneReviews is a registered trademark of the University of Washington, Seattle. All rights reserved. Management GeneReviews Targeted therapies: Treatments can include the use of dopamine agonists (pramipexole, ropinirole, rotigotine patch, or bromocriptine), MAO inhibitors (selegiline or tranylcypromine), vitamin B6 (pyridoxine, pyridoxal phosphate), folinic acid, and (in rare cases) levodopa in a preparation without carbidopa. Putaminal delivery of eladocagene exuparvovec (Upstaza) was approved in the European Union and United Kingdom for the treatment of individuals aged 18 months and older with a clinical, molecular, and genetically confirmed diagnosis of AADC deficiency with a severe phenotype (i.e., individuals who cannot sit, stand, or walk); this treatment is not currently FDA approved for use in the United States. Supportive care: Feeding therapy with consideration of gastrostomy tube placement or jejunal feeding; anticholinergic drugs and/or sleep induction for movement disorders / oculogyric crisis; xylometazoline or oxymetazoline nasal drops for autonomic dysfunction; melatonin or clonidine for sleep disturbance; and standard therapies for epilepsy, developmental delay / intellectual disability, musculoskeletal issues, bowel dysfunction (constipation, diarrhea, or gastroesophageal reflux disease), strabismus, visual impairment, obstructive sleep apnea, hypoglycemia, and hearing loss. Surveillance: At each visit: measurement of growth parameters; evaluation of nutritional status and safety of oral intake; monitor frequency and severity of oculogyric crises and movement disorders; assess for new manifestations, such as seizures, changes in tone, and movement disorders; monitor developmental progress and educational needs; monitor for behavioral issues and symptoms of anxiety, ADHD, ASD, aggression, & self- injury; clinical assessment for kyphoscoliosis and hip dislocation; monitor for constipation, diarrhea, gastroesophageal reflux, and abdominal discomfort or pain; and monitor for evidence of aspiration, respiratory insufficiency, sleep disturbance, and frequency of respiratory infections. Annually: obtain hip and spinal radiographs (until skeletal maturity); consider cardiology evaluation; consider continuous glucose monitoring, especially in younger affected individuals. Per treating clinicians: ophthalmology evaluation; monitor for cardiac function and rhythm defects; monitor for symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea and nasal congestion. In those on levodopa treatment: monitor CSF neurotransmitters, including 5-methyltetrahydrofolate levels, as clinically indicated to assess for secondary folate deficiency, particularly if neurologic symptoms worsen. In those on bromocriptine therapy: echocardiogram and EKG every 6-12 months to monitor for vavlulopathy caused by valve fibrosis (the risk is lower than with other ergot-derived dopamine agonists such as pergolide, but not absent). Agents/circumstances to avoid: Ergot-derived dopamine agonists with strong serotonergic (5-HT2B) agonist action (pergolide and cabergoline) due to risk of cardiac valvulopathy and other fibrotic complications; levodopa in most affected individuals who do not have ligand binding site pathogenic variants; dopamine receptor antagonists (e.g., metoclopramide, antipsychotic medications), which may worsen primary disease symptoms. Evaluation of relatives at risk: Testing of all at-risk sibs of any age is warranted to allow for early diagnosis and treatment of AADC deficiency. Molecular genetic testing is recommended if the pathogenic variants in the family are known; measurement of CSF neurotransmitters (to evaluate for the characteristic profile) and plasma AADC enzyme activity is recommended if the pathogenic variants in the family are not known. Pregnancy management: Successful pregnancy has been documented in an affected woman with a mild phenotype who took low-dose pramipexole and selegiline during pregnancy. Genetic counseling AADC deficiency is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. If both parents are known to be heterozygous for a DDC pathogenic variant, each sib of an affected individual has at conception a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Heterozygotes (carriers) are asymptomatic. If both DDC pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected L-Amino Acid Decarboxylase Deficiency 3 family member, molecular genetic carrier testing for at-risk relatives and prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing are possible."

    "_id": "ab-lipo-p",
    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Abetalipoproteinemia typically presents in infancy with failure to thrive, diarrhea, vomiting, and malabsorption of fat. Hematologic manifestations may include acanthocytosis (irregularly spiculated erythrocytes), anemia, reticulocytosis, and hemolysis with resultant hyperbilirubinemia. Malabsorption of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K) can result in an increased international normalized ratio (INR). Untreated individuals may develop atypical pigmentation of the retina that may present with progressive loss of night vision and/or color vision in adulthood. Neuromuscular findings in untreated individuals including progressive loss of deep tendon reflexes, vibratory sense, and proprioception; muscle weakness; dysarthria; and ataxia typically manifest in the first or second decades of life. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of abetalipoproteinemia is established in a proband with absent or extremely low LDL-cholesterol, triglyceride, and apolipoprotein (apo) B levels and biallelic pathogenic variants in MTTP identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Adequate caloric intake to alleviate growth deficiency; low-fat diet (10%-20% of total calories from fat); oral essential fatty acid supplementation (up to 1 teaspoon per day of oils rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids, as tolerated); supplementation with vitamin A (100-400 IU/kg/day), vitamin D (800-1,200 IU/day), vitamin E (100-300 IU/kg/day), and vitamin K (5-35 mg/week). Mild anemia rarely requires treatment, although occasionally vitamin B12 or iron therapy may be considered. Dysarthria, ataxia, and hypothyroidism are treated in the standard fashion.

Copyright 1993-2024, University of Washington, Seattle. GeneReviews is a registered trademark of the University of Washington, Seattle. All rights reserved. GeneReviews Prevention of primary manifestations: Most complications can be prevented through institution of a low-fat diet with supplementation of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K). Surveillance: Assessment of growth parameters at each visit. Complete blood count, INR, reticulocyte count, liver function tests (AST, ALT, GGT, total and direct bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, and albumin), fat-soluble vitamin levels (vitamin A [retinol], 25-OH vitamin D, and plasma or red blood cell vitamin E concentrations), serum calcium, serum phosphate, serum uric acid, and TSH levels annually. Lipid profile (total cholesterol, triglyceride concentration, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, apo B, and apo A-I) every several years. Ultrasound of the liver every three years. Ophthalmology and neurology evaluations every six to 12 months. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Fatty foods, particularly those rich in long-chain fatty acids. Evaluation of relatives at risk: Sibs of a proband should undergo a full lipid profile and apolipoprotein (apo) B determination to allow for early diagnosis and treatment of findings. If the pathogenic MTTP variants in the family are known, molecular genetic testing may also be used to determine the genetic status of at-risk sibs. In classic abetalipoproteinemia, affected sibs will present shortly after birth with failure to thrive, diarrhea, vomiting, and malabsorption of fat. Pregnancy management: Vitamin A excess can be harmful to the developing fetus. Therefore, women who are pregnant or who are planning to become pregnant should reduce their vitamin A supplement dose by 50%. Additionally, close monitoring of serum beta carotene levels throughout pregnancy is recommended. Because vitamin A is an essential vitamin, vitamin A supplementation should not be discontinued during pregnancy. Genetic counseling Abetalipoproteinemia is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. At conception, each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Carrier testing for at-risk relatives and prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing are possible if the pathogenic MTTP variants in the family are known."

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase deficiency (PORD) is a disorder of steroidogenesis with a broad phenotypic spectrum including cortisol deficiency, altered sex steroid synthesis, disorders of sex development (DSD), and skeletal malformations of the Antley-Bixler syndrome (ABS) phenotype. Cortisol deficiency is usually partial, with some baseline cortisol production but failure to mount an adequate cortisol response in stress. Mild mineralocorticoid excess can be present and causes arterial hypertension, usually presenting in young adulthood. Manifestations of altered sex steroid synthesis include ambiguous genitalia/DSD in both males and females, large ovarian cysts in females, poor masculinization and delayed puberty in males, and maternal virilization during pregnancy with an affected fetus. Skeletal malformations can manifest as craniosynostosis, mid-face retrusion with proptosis and choanal stenosis or atresia, low-set dysplastic ears with stenotic external auditory canals, hydrocephalus, radiohumeral synostosis, neonatal fractures, congenital bowing of the long bones, joint contractures, arachnodactyly, and clubfeet; other anomalies observed include urinary tract anomalies (renal pelvic dilatation, vesicoureteral reflux). Cognitive impairment is of minor concern and likely associated with the severity of malformations; studies of developmental outcomes are lacking. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of PORD can be established by urinary steroid profiling using gas chromatography / mass spectrometry (GC/MS), which documents combined impairment of 17-hydroxylase (CYP17A1) and 21- hydroxylase (CYP21A2) enzymatic activity located at key branch points of cortisol, aldosterone, and sex steroid synthesis. Identification of biallelic POR pathogenic variants on molecular genetic testing confirms the diagnosis. Molecular genetic testing is desirable for all individuals affected by PORD to confirm the diagnosis, but is mandatory if clinical and laboratory features are inconclusive.

Management GeneReviews Treatment of manifestations: Glucocorticoid replacement therapy for cortisol deficiency including stress-dose cover in intercurrent illness; surgery as needed for craniosynostosis, hypospadias, and cryptorchidism in males and clitoromegaly and vaginal hypoplasia in females; dihydrotestosterone treatment has been successful in some males with micropenis; testosterone replacement in males in whom testosterone levels remain relatively low after onset of puberty; females with absent pubertal development may require estrogen replacement therapy; treatment with estradiol to reduce the size of ovarian cysts; endotracheal intubation, nasal stints or tracheotomy, and tracheostomy as needed; physical and occupational therapy for joint contractures and help with fine and gross motor skills. Prevention of secondary complications: Supplementation with appropriate steroid hormones in individuals who are deficient has helped alleviate adrenal crisis, lack of or poor pubertal development in males and females, sleepiness, and fatigue. Early intervention services may improve the outcome for individuals at risk for developmental delays and learning difficulties. Surveillance: Evaluations with a specialist tertiary pediatric endocrine service throughout childhood to closely monitor development and adjust steroid supplementation. Periodic formal developmental assessments in centers with expertise and experience in developmental testing. Evaluation of relatives at risk: It is appropriate to evaluate apparently asymptomatic older and younger sibs of a proband in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from initiation of treatment and preventive measures. Genetic counseling PORD is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. At conception, each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Carrier testing for at-risk family members and prenatal genetic testing for pregnancies at increased risk are possible if the POR pathogenic variants have been identified in the family. In addition, noninvasive testing of maternal urine steroid excretion by GC/MS can indicate whether the unborn child is affected by PORD from gestational week 12 onwards."

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Achromatopsia is characterized by reduced visual acuity, pendular nystagmus, increased sensitivity to light (photophobia), a small central scotoma, eccentric fixation, and reduced or complete loss of color discrimination. All individuals with achromatopsia (achromats) have impaired color discrimination along all three axes of color vision corresponding to the three cone classes: the protan or long-wavelength-sensitive cone axis (red), the deutan or middle-wavelength-sensitive cone axis (green), and the tritan or short-wavelength-sensitive cone axis (blue). Most individuals have complete achromatopsia, with total lack of function of all three types of cones. Rarely, individuals have incomplete achromatopsia, in which one or more cone types may be partially functioning. The manifestations are similar to those of individuals with complete achromatopsia, but generally less severe. Hyperopia is common in achromatopsia. Nystagmus develops during the first few weeks after birth followed by increased sensitivity to bright light. Best visual acuity varies with severity of the disease; it is 20/200 or less in complete achromatopsia and may be as high as 20/80 in incomplete achromatopsia. Visual acuity is usually stable over time; both nystagmus and sensitivity to bright light may improve slightly. Although the fundus is usually normal, macular changes (which may show early signs of progression) and vessel narrowing may be present in some affected individuals. Defects in the macula are visible on optical coherence tomography. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of achromatopsia is established in a proband through clinical and family history, examination for nystagmus, visual acuity testing, color vision assessment, and fundoscopic examination. If achromatopsia is suspected, additional testing may include optical coherence tomography, fundus autofluorescence, visual fields, and electroretinogram. Identification of biallelic pathogenic (or likely pathogenic) variants in ATF6, CNGA3, CNGB3, GNAT2, PDE6C, or PDE6H confirms the clinical diagnosis.

    "_id": "achondroplasia",
    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Achondroplasia is the most common cause of disproportionate short stature. Affected individuals have rhizomelic shortening of the limbs, macrocephaly, and characteristic facial features with frontal bossing and midface retrusion. In infancy, hypotonia is typical, and acquisition of developmental motor milestones is often both aberrant in pattern and delayed. Intelligence and life span are usually near normal, although craniocervical junction compression increases the risk of death in infancy. Additional complications include obstructive sleep apnea, middle ear dysfunction, kyphosis, and spinal stenosis. Diagnosis/testing Achondroplasia can be diagnosed by characteristic clinical and radiographic findings in most affected individuals. In individuals in whom there is diagnostic uncertainty or who have atypical findings, identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in FGFR3 can establish the diagnosis. Management Treatment of manifestations: Vosoritide, a C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) analog, was recently approved to enhance height in individuals with achondroplasia from age five years until growth plates close. Ventriculoperitoneal shunt may be required for increased intracranial pressure; suboccipital decompression as indicated for signs and symptoms of craniocervical junction compression; adenotonsillectomy, positive airway pressure, and, rarely, tracheostomy to correct obstructive sleep apnea; pressure-equalizing tubes for middle ear dysfunction; monitor and treat obesity; evaluation and treatment by an orthopedist if progressive bowing of the legs arises; spinal surgery may be needed for severe, persistent kyphosis; surgery to correct spinal stenosis in symptomatic adults; modification in the school and work setting to optimize function; educational support in socialization and school adjustment.

Avoid activities in which there is risk of injury to the craniocervical junction, such as collision sports; use of a trampoline; diving from diving boards; vaulting in gymnastics; and hanging upside down from the knees or feet on playground equipment (due to risk of falling onto the head or neck). Pregnancy management: Pregnant women with achondroplasia must undergo cesarean section delivery because of small pelvic size. Genetic counseling Achondroplasia is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Around 80% of individuals with achondroplasia have parents with average stature and have achondroplasia as the result of a de novo pathogenic variant. Such parents have a very low risk of having another child with achondroplasia. An individual with achondroplasia who has a reproductive partner with average stature is at 50% risk in each pregnancy of having a child with achondroplasia. When both parents have achondroplasia, the risk to their offspring of having average stature is 25%; of having achondroplasia, 50%; and of having homozygous achondroplasia (a lethal condition), 25%. If the proband and the proband's reproductive partner are affected with different dominantly inherited skeletal dysplasias, genetic counseling becomes more complicated because of the risk of inheriting two dominant skeletal dysplasias. If the FGFR3 pathogenic variant has been identified in the affected parent or parents, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk for achondroplasia is possible."

The clinical triad of retinal degeneration, diabetes mellitus (DM), and neurologic disease is seen in individuals ranging from age 30 years to older than 70 years. The neurologic findings of movement disorder (blepharospasm, grimacing, facial and neck dystonia, tremors, chorea) and ataxia (gait ataxia, dysarthria) correspond to regions of iron deposition in the brain. Individuals with aceruloplasminemia often present with anemia prior to onset of DM or obvious neurologic problems. Cognitive dysfunction including apathy and forgetfulness occurs in more than half of individuals with this condition. Diagnosis/testing Aceruloplasminemia, a disorder of iron metabolism caused by the complete absence of ceruloplasmin ferroxidase activity, is associated with very low to absent serum ceruloplasmin and some combination of the following: Low serum copper concentration Low serum iron concentration High serum ferritin concentration Increased hepatic iron concentration The diagnosis of aceruloplasminemia is established in a proband with typical clinical findings and the identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in CP by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Iron chelating agents (i.e., desferrioxamine, deferiprone, or deferasirox) to decrease serum ferritin concentration, decrease brain and liver iron stores, and prevent progression of neurologic signs/ symptoms in symptomatic individuals with blood hemoglobin concentration higher than 9 g/dL; combined IV Author Affiliation: 1 First Department of Medicine Hamamatsu University School of Medicine Hamamatsu, Japan; Email: miyajima@hama-med.ac.jp; Email: y.hosoi@hama-med.ac.jp.

Affected individuals present in the first or second decade with either cardiac symptoms (palpitations and/or syncope) or weakness that occurs spontaneously following prolonged rest or following rest after exertion. Mild permanent weakness is common. Mild learning difficulties and a distinct neurocognitive phenotype (i.e., deficits in executive function and abstract reasoning) have been described. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of ATS is established in an individual with characteristic clinical and EKG findings and/or identification of a pathogenic variant in KCNJ2. Management Treatment of manifestations: For episodic weakness: if serum potassium concentration is low (<3.0 mmol/L), administration of oral potassium (20-30 mEq/L) every 15-30 minutes (not to exceed 200 mEq in a 12-hour period) until the serum concentration normalizes; if a relative drop in serum potassium within the normal range causes episodic paralysis, an individual potassium replacement regimen with a goal of maintaining serum potassium levels in the high range of normal can be considered; if serum potassium concentration is high, ingesting carbohydrates may lower serum potassium levels. Mild exercise may shorten or reduce the severity of the attack.

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics ACTG2 visceral myopathy is a disorder of smooth muscle dysfunction of the bladder and gastrointestinal system with phenotypic spectrum that ranges from mild to severe. Bladder involvement can range from neonatal megacystis and megaureter (with its most extreme form of prune belly syndrome) at the more severe end, to recurrent urinary tract infections and bladder dysfunction at the milder end. Intestinal involvement can range from malrotation, neonatal manifestations of microcolon, megacystis microcolon intestinal hypoperistalsis syndrome, and chronic intestinal pseudoobstruction (CIPO) in neonates at the more severe end to intermittent abdominal distention and functional intestinal obstruction at the milder end. Affected infants (with or without evidence of intestinal malrotation) often present with feeding intolerance and findings of non-mechanical bowel obstruction that persist after successful surgical correction of malrotation. Individuals who develop manifestations of CIPO in later childhood or adulthood often experience episodic waxing and waning of bowel motility. They may undergo frequent abdominal surgeries (perhaps related to malrotation or adhesions causing mechanical obstruction) resulting in resection of dilated segments of bowel, often becoming dependent on total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of ACTG2 visceral myopathy is established in a proband with suggestive findings and a heterozygous ACTG2 pathogenic variant identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations. Treatment is supportive. Specialized centers offer multidisciplinary medical and surgical models of care including comprehensive TPN management and multivisceral transplantation. Chronic bladder dysfunction typically requires management by a urologist and can involve routine urinary catheterization or diversion to reduce the risk of dilation of the upper urinary tract and associated risk for urinary tract infection and renal functional impairment.

GeneReviews and associated gastrointestinal comorbidities typically require management by a gastroenterologist and nutritionist familiar with intestinal motility disorders. Surveillance: Surveillance should be individualized using a multidisciplinary approach. For bladder and urinary tract comorbidities, monitor voiding, urinary tract anatomy, and renal function. For intestinal manifestations, monitor nutritional status and possible TPN-associated complications (line infections, liver disease) and consider need for multivisceral or isolated intestinal transplantation. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Treatment/medications (including opioids) to be avoided or limited include those that diminish bowel and bladder motility. Evaluation of relatives at risk: It is appropriate to clarify the genetic status of relatives at risk as early diagnosis may help prevent unnecessary surgery for manifestations of intestinal obstruction and may allow early evaluation of bladder and renal function, and of the urinary tract for evidence of dilatation. Pregnancy management: When a fetus at risk for ACTG2 visceral myopathy has evidence of bladder distention on prenatal ultrasound examination, consultation with a maternal fetal medicine specialist is recommended. Genetic counseling ACTG2 visceral myopathy is typically inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. (Apparent autosomal recessive inheritance, suggested in one family, is not discussed further in the Summary.) Approximately 73% of individuals with ACTG2 visceral myopathy have a de novo pathogenic variant. If a parent is known to have the pathogenic variant identified in the proband, the risk to the sibs of inheriting the pathogenic variant is 50%. Although penetrance of ACTG2 visceral myopathy appears to be complete, the severity of clinical findings can vary between heterozygous family members. Each child of an individual with ACTG2 visceral myopathy has a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant. Once the ACTG2 pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible."

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency is a systemic purine metabolic disorder that primarily affects lymphocyte development, viability, and function. The ADA deficiency phenotypic spectrum includes typical early-onset severe combined immunodeficiency (ADA-SCID), diagnosed in infancy (about 80% of individuals), and less severe \\\"delayed\\\" or \\\"late-onset\\\" combined immunodeficiency (ADA-CID), diagnosed in older children and adults (15%-20% of individuals). Some healthy individuals who are deficient in red blood cell ADA (termed \\\"partial ADA deficiency\\\") have been discovered by screening populations or relatives of individuals with ADA- SCID. Newborn screening (NBS) for SCID uses extracts from Guthrie card dried blood spots to measure T-cell receptor excision circle (TREC) DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Screening specific for ADA deficiency can also be performed by detection of elevated levels of adenosine (Ado) and deoxyadenosine (dAdo) by tandem mass spectrometry (TMS). Both techniques can identify ADA-SCID before affected infants become symptomatic. Untreated ADA-SCID presents as life-threatening opportunistic illnesses in the first weeks to months of life with poor linear growth and weight gain secondary to persistent diarrhea, extensive dermatitis, and recurrent pneumonia. Skeletal abnormalities affecting ribs and vertebra, pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, hemolytic anemia, neurologic abnormalities, and transaminitis may also suggest untreated ADA-SCID. Characteristic immune abnormalities are lymphocytopenia (low numbers of T, B, and NK cells) combined with the absence of both humoral and cellular immune function. If immune function is not restored with enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), gene therapy, or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), children with ADA-SCID rarely survive beyond age one to two years. NBS for SCID does not identify individuals with the ADA-CID phenotype whose TREC numbers are above the threshold values of most screening laboratories. However, ADA-CID is identified by TMS NBS since the ADA Author Affiliations: 1 Professor of Medicine and Biochemistry, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina; Email: michael.hershfield@duke.edu. 2 Associate Professor of Medicine, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina; Email: teresa.tarrant@duke.edu.

GeneReviews substrates Ado and dAdo are increased. As TMS NBS for Ado/dAdo is not yet widely performed, individuals with ADA-CID are more often clinically diagnosed between ages one and ten years (\\\"delayed\\\" onset), or less often in the second to fourth decades (\\\"late\\\"/\\\"adult\\\" onset). Because the immunologic abnormalities are less pronounced than those of ADA-SCID, infections in ADA-CID may not be life-threatening and include recurrent otitis media, sinusitis, upper respiratory infections, and human papilloma viral infections. Untreated individuals with ADA-CID can develop over time chronic pulmonary disease, autoimmunity, atopic disease with elevated immunoglobulin E, and malignancy. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of ADA deficiency is established in a proband with suggestive findings either by biochemical testing showing <1% of ADA catalytic activity in red blood cells or in extracts of dried blood spots (valid in untransfused individuals), or by molecular genetic testing identifying biallelic pathogenic variants in ADA. Frequently, both types of testing are performed. Management Treatment of manifestations: Newborns with an abnormal NBS result suggestive of ADA-SCID (by either method) require immediate protection from risk factors for infection and referral for a subspecialty immunology evaluation at a center with expertise in both diagnosis of SCID and its genetic causes and SCID treatment protocols. Symptomatic treatment involves treatment of infections and use of immunoglobulin infusions and antibiotics, particularly prophylaxis against Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (formerly Pneumocystis carinii) and fungal infections. Prophylaxis against viral infections depends upon exposure and requires frequent surveillance via viral PCR-based testing, with appropriate targeted virus-specific therapy if present. Targeted therapies: Correcting the ADA deficiency either systemically or selectively in lymphoid cells employs one of three options: (1) enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) by intramuscular administration of PEGylated ADA, (2) allogeneic HSCT, or (3) autologous hematopoietic stem cell ADA gene therapy (HSC-GT) the latter two are curative. Often, ERT is initiated first to rapidly correct the metabolic defect and to protect against serious infections as well as neurologic/behavioral abnormalities. It is discontinued at the time HSCT or HSC-GT is performed. Surveillance: The following evaluations are recommended to monitor existing and emerging clinical manifestations and the response to targeted treatment and supportive care: (1) absolute lymphocyte subset counts (T, B, NK cells), quantitative serum immunoglobulin levels, and various in vitro tests of cellular and humoral immune function; (2) total red blood cell deoxyadenosine nucleotides (dAXP) and, if on ERT, plasma ADA activity; and (3) screening for Epstein-Bar virus (EBV)-related lymphoma or other lymphomas after age three years, particularly when lymphocyte counts are declining while on prolonged ERT. Agents/circumstances to avoid: To ensure the safety of the infant/older individual with ADA deficiency while treatment to achieve immunocompetence is pending, parents and other care providers need to avoid the following risks of infection: (1) breastfeeding and breast milk until maternal CMV status is established by CMV serologies; (2) exposure to young children, sick contacts, individuals with cold sores, crowded enclosed spaces, and sources of aerosolized fungal spores such as areas of construction or soil manipulation; (3) live viral vaccines for the affected infant as well as household contacts; and (4) transfusion of non-irradiated blood products. Medications to avoid include adenine arabinoside, a substrate for ADA, as an antiviral agent and/or as chemotherapy of malignancies; and pentostatin, a potent ADA inhibitor used to treat some lymphoid malignancies, which would be ineffective in persons with ADA deficiency and would interfere with PEGylated ADA. Deaminase Deficiency 3 Evaluation of relatives at risk: In an at-risk fetus, when the ADA pathogenic variants causing ADA-SCID in the family are known, prenatal genetic testing may be performed to help prepare for optimal management of an affected infant at birth (i.e., identification of a center with expertise in SCID treatment protocols that can help initiate ERT and the search for an HSCT donor and explain ways to ensure the safety of the infant while awaiting HSCT). If prenatal testing has not been performed, an at-risk newborn clinically suspected of SCID should immediately be placed in an appropriate environment to reduce the risk of infection, and the following testing should be performed before administration of a blood transfusion to allow earliest possible diagnosis and initiation of treatment: identification of the ADA pathogenic variants and measurement of ADA catalytic activity and level of dAXP in red blood cells. Therapies under investigation: Various approaches to HSC-GT are under investigation. Genetic counseling ADA deficiency is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. If both parents are known to be heterozygous for an ADA pathogenic variant, each sib of an affected individual has at conception a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of inheriting neither of the familial pathogenic variants. An individual who inherits two pathogenic ADA variants will have either ADA-SCID or a delayed or late-onset ADA-CID phenotype that correlates with the least severe ADA pathogenic variant inherited. Once the ADA pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member, carrier testing for at-risk relatives and prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing are possible."

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Adenosine deaminase 2 deficiency (DADA2) is a complex systemic autoinflammatory disorder in which vasculopathy/vasculitis, dysregulated immune function, and/or hematologic abnormalities may predominate. Inflammatory features include intermittent fevers, rash (often livedo racemosa/reticularis), and musculoskeletal involvement (myalgia/arthralgia, arthritis, myositis). Vasculitis, which usually begins before age ten years, may manifest as early-onset ischemic (lacunar) and/or hemorrhagic strokes, or as cutaneous or systemic polyarteritis nodosa. Hypertension and hepatosplenomegaly are often found. More severe involvement may lead to progressive central neurologic deficits (dysarthria, ataxia, cranial nerve palsies, cognitive impairment) or to ischemic injury to the kidney, intestine, and/or digits. Dysregulation of immune function can lead to immunodeficiency or autoimmunity of varying severity; lymphadenopathy may be present and some affected individuals have had lymphoproliferative disease. Hematologic disorders may begin early in life or in late adulthood, and can include lymphopenia, neutropenia, pure red cell aplasia, thrombocytopenia, or pancytopenia. Of note, both interfamilial and intrafamilial phenotypic variability (e.g., in age of onset, frequency and severity of manifestations) can be observed; also, individuals with biallelic ADA2 pathogenic variants may remain asymptomatic until adulthood or may never develop clinical manifestations of DADA2. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of DADA2 is established in a proband with suggestive clinical and laboratory findings and biallelic loss-of-function ADA2 pathogenic variants identified by molecular testing and/or low (<5% of normal) or undetectable ADA2 catalytic activity in plasma or serum.

Clinical characteristics Adams-Oliver syndrome (AOS) is characterized by aplasia cutis congenita (ACC) of the scalp and terminal transverse limb defects (TTLD). ACC lesions usually occur in the midline of the parietal or occipital regions, but can also occur on the abdomen or limbs. At birth, an ACC lesion may already have the appearance of a healed scar. ACC lesions less than 5 cm often involve only the skin and almost always heal over a period of months; larger lesions are more likely to involve the skull and possibly the dura, and are at greater risk for complications, which can include infection, hemorrhage, or thrombosis, and can result in death. The limb defects range from mild (unilateral or bilateral short distal phalanges) to severe (complete absence of all toes or fingers, feet or hands, or more, often resembling an amputation). The lower extremities are almost always more severely affected than the upper extremities. Additional major features frequently include cardiovascular malformations/ dysfunction (23%), brain anomalies, and less frequently renal, liver, and eye anomalies. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of AOS can be established in a proband with one of the following: Clinical findings of ACC of the scalp and TTLD ACC or TTLD and a first-degree relative with findings consistent with AOS ACC or TTLD and either a pathogenic variant in an autosomal dominant AOS-related gene (ARHGAP31, DLL4, NOTCH1, or RBPJ) or two pathogenic variants in an autosomal recessive AOS-related gene (DOCK6 or EOGT) Author Affiliations: 1 Department of Medical Genetics, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada; Email: alehman@cw.bc.ca; Email: mpatel@cw.bc.ca. 2 Department of Medical Genetics, University of Antwerp and Antwerp University Hospital, Antwerp, Belgium; Email: wim.wuyts@uantwerpen.be.

Typical eye findings are dislocation of the lens, congenital abnormalities of the iris, refractive errors that may lead to amblyopia, and early-onset cataract. Increased intraocular pressure and retinal detachment may occur on occasion. Eye findings can vary within a family and between the eyes in an individual. In general, no additional systemic manifestations are observed, although skeletal features have been reported in a few affected individuals. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis is established in individuals with characteristic eye findings by the identification of biallelic pathogenic (or likely pathogenic) variants in ADAMTSL4 by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: In children, the main objective is to prevent amblyopia by early correction of refractive errors and patching. Surgery should be considered in individuals with cataracts, those at risk for complications caused by the dislocated lens, those in whom patching does not result in improvement of visual acuity, those in whom the lens edge is in the middle of the pupil, and those with insufficient correction of refractive errors, in particular large degrees of astigmatism. While lensectomy with anterior vitrectomy and correction of the aphakia with contact lenses or secondary intraocular lens (IOL) replacement has been the usual procedure in the past, capsule-sparing lens surgery has recently been introduced.

To date, affected individuals have had overlapping (but not identical) manifestations with wide-ranging severity. The facial movements are typically periorbital and perioral. The dyskinesia is prone to episodic or paroxysmal exacerbation lasting minutes to hours, and may occur during sleep. Precipitating factors in some persons have included emotional stress, intercurrent illness, sneezing, or caffeine; in others, no precipitating factors have been identified. In some children, severe infantile axial hypotonia results in gross motor delays accompanied by chorea, sometimes with language delays. The overall tendency is for the abnormal movements to stabilize in early middle age, at which point they may improve in some individuals; less commonly, the abnormal movements are slowly progressive, increasing in severity and frequency. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of ADCY5 dyskinesia is established in a proband with a hyperkinetic movement disorder (in the absence of structural brain abnormalities) and a heterozygous pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant (or, rarely, biallelic pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants) in ADCY5 identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Management by multidisciplinary specialists, including a neurologist or neurogeneticist, cardiologist, physical therapist, social worker, speech and language pathologist, and other specialists is recommended as needed.

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Autosomal dominant sleep-related hypermotor (hyperkinetic) epilepsy (ADSHE) is a seizure disorder characterized by clusters of nocturnal motor seizures that are often stereotyped and brief (<2 minutes). They vary from simple arousals from sleep to dramatic, often hyperkinetic events with tonic or dystonic features. Affected individuals may experience an aura. Retained awareness during seizures is common. A minority of individuals experience daytime seizures. Age of onset ranges from infancy to adulthood. About 80% of individuals develop ADSHE in the first two decades of life; mean age of onset is ten years. Clinical neurologic examination is normal and intellect is usually preserved, but reduced intellect, psychiatric comorbidities, or cognitive deficits may occur. Within a family, the manifestations of the disorder may vary considerably. ADSHE is lifelong but not progressive. As an individual reaches middle age, seizures may become milder and less frequent. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of ADSHE is established in a proband who has suggestive clinical findings and a family history consistent with autosomal dominant inheritance and/or a heterozygous pathogenic variant in CABP4, CHRNA4, CHRNA2, CHRNB2, CRH, DEPDC5, KCNT1, NPRL2, NPRL3, or STX1B identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Many anti-seizure medications (ASM) may be effective. Carbamazepine is associated with remission in about 70% of individuals, often in relatively low doses. Individuals with ADSHE associated with the CHRNA4 pathogenic variant p.Ser284Leu are more responsive to zonisamide than carbamazepine. KCNT1-related ADSHE is difficult to treat but may be treatable using quinidine based on limited data.

Adjunctive fenofibrate therapy or vagal nerve stimulation may be considered in individuals resistant to standard ASM. Surveillance: Reevaluation of EEGs at regular intervals to monitor disease progression, as well as assessment for changes in seizure semiology, changes in tone, and movement disorders; monitoring of developmental progress and educational needs. Evaluation of relatives at risk: A medical history from relatives at risk can identify those with ADSHE so that treatment can be initiated promptly. Pregnancy management: Discussion of the risks and benefits of using a given ASM during pregnancy should ideally take place prior to conception. Transitioning to a lower-risk medication prior to pregnancy may be possible. Genetic counseling ADSHE, by definition, is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Most individuals diagnosed with ADSHE have an affected parent. Each child of an individual with ADSHE has a 50% chance of inheriting the ADSHE- related pathogenic variant; the chance that the offspring will manifest ADSHE is (50% x 70% =) 35%, assuming penetrance of 70%. If the ADSHE-related pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible."

A subgroup of infants with AGS present at birth with abnormal neurologic findings, hepatosplenomegaly, elevated liver enzymes, and thrombocytopenia, a picture highly suggestive of congenital infection. Otherwise, most affected infants present at variable times after the first few weeks of life, frequently after a period of apparently normal development. Typically, they demonstrate the subacute onset of a severe encephalopathy characterized by extreme irritability, intermittent sterile pyrexias, loss of skills, and slowing of head growth. Over time, as many as 40% develop chilblain skin lesions on the fingers, toes, and ears. It is becoming apparent that atypical, sometimes milder, cases of AGS exist, and thus the true extent of the phenotype associated with pathogenic variants in the AGS-related genes is not yet known.

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics NR0B1-related adrenal hypoplasia congenita includes both X-linked adrenal hypoplasia congenita (X-linked AHC) and Xp21 deletion (previously called complex glycerol kinase deficiency). X-linked AHC is characterized by primary adrenal insufficiency and/or hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH). Adrenal insufficiency is acute infantile onset (average age 3 weeks) in approximately 60% of affected males and childhood onset (ages 1-9 years) in approximately 40%. HH typically manifests in a male with adrenal insufficiency as delayed puberty (i.e., onset age >14 years) and less commonly as arrested puberty at about Tanner Stage 3. Rarely, X-linked AHC manifests initially in early adulthood as delayed-onset adrenal insufficiency, partial HH, and/or infertility. Heterozygous females very occasionally have manifestations of adrenal insufficiency or hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. Xp21 deletion includes deletion of NR0B1 (causing X-linked AHC) and GK (causing glycerol kinase deficiency), and in some cases deletion of DMD (causing Duchenne muscular dystrophy). Developmental delay has been reported in males with Xp21 deletion when the deletion extends proximally to include DMD or when larger deletions extend distally to include IL1RAPL1 and DMD. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of NR0B1-related adrenal hypoplasia congenita is established in a male proband by detection of either a hemizygous pathogenic variant in NR0B1 or a non-recurrent Xp21 deletion that includes NR0B1. Management Treatment of manifestations: Episodes of acute adrenal insufficiency are usually treated in an intensive care unit with close monitoring of blood pressure, hydration, clinical status, and serum concentration of glucose and electrolytes. Once the initial acute episode has been treated, affected individuals are started on replacement doses of glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids and in younger children oral supplements of sodium Author Affiliations: 1 Genetics and Genomic Medicine UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health University College London London, United Kingdom; Email: j.achermann@ucl.ac.uk. 2 Center for Genetic Medicine Research Children's National Medical Center Washington, DC; Email: evilain@childrensnational.org.

Steroid dosage must be increased during periods of stress (e.g., intercurrent illness, surgery, trauma); glucose and sodium may be needed. HH may be treated with increasing doses of testosterone to induce age- appropriate puberty and should be monitored by a pediatric endocrinologist. Treatment is usually initiated at around or just after the time puberty would be expected (age 12 years in boys). Surveillance: If mineralocorticoid production is sufficient at the time of initial diagnosis, long-term follow up of adrenal mineralocorticoid function is necessary. If glucocorticoid production is sufficient at the time of initial diagnosis, long-term follow up of adrenal glucocorticoid function is necessary. If puberty has not started by age 14 years, monitoring of serum concentrations of LH, FSH, testosterone, and inhibin B to evaluate for the possibility of HH is necessary. If puberty has started spontaneously, it is likely to arrest; thus, yearly routine monitoring of levels of LH, FSH, and testosterone is necessary. Evaluation of relatives at risk: At birth: If the genetic status of an at-risk male relative has not been established prior to birth by prenatal molecular genetic testing, it is appropriate to monitor him with biochemical testing for evidence of adrenal insufficiency in the first few days of life in order to determine if he would benefit from prompt initiation of glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid hormone replacement therapy to avoid a salt-losing adrenal crisis. Later in childhood: When the NR0B1 pathogenic variant in the family is known, it is reasonable to clarify the genetic status of at-risk asymptomatic maternal male relatives by molecular genetic testing as approximately 40% of affected males will not manifest adrenal insufficiency until childhood or later. Genetic counseling NR0B1-related adrenal hypoplasia congenita is inherited in an X-linked manner. X-linked AHC: The risk to sibs depends on the genetic status of the mother: if the mother is heterozygous for an NR0B1 pathogenic variant, the chance of transmitting it in each pregnancy is 50%. Males who inherit the pathogenic variant will be affected; females who inherit the pathogenic variant will typically not be affected but will be carriers. Most males with AHC are infertile. Xp21 deletion: Although most mothers of an individual diagnosed with an Xp21 deletion are carriers, a proband may have the disorder as the result of a de novo contiguous gene deletion. The risk to the sibs of the proband depends on the genetic status of the mother: if the mother is heterozygous for the Xp21 deletion, the chance of transmitting the deletion in each pregnancy is 50%. Males who inherit the deletion will be affected; females who inherit the deletion will typically not be affected. Once the NR0B1 pathogenic variant or Xp21 deletion has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing are possible."

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Aicardi syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects primarily females. Initially it was characterized by a typical triad of agenesis of the corpus callosum, central chorioretinal lacunae, and infantile spasms. As more affected individuals have been ascertained, it has become clear that not all affected girls have all three features of the classic triad and that other neurologic and systemic defects are common, including other brain malformations, optic nerve abnormalities, other seizure types, intellectual disability of varying severity, and scoliosis. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of Aicardi syndrome is based exclusively on clinical findings. Modified diagnostic criteria include either presence of the classic triad or the presence of two of the classic triad plus at least two other major or supporting features. A gene for Aicardi syndrome has not been identified, but several observations support a hypothesis that Aicardi syndrome is caused by de novo pathogenic variants in a gene on the X chromosome that is subject to X-chromosome inactivation. Management Treatment of manifestations: Treatment is individualized and long-term management by a pediatric neurologist with expertise in management of infantile spasms and medically refractory epilepsy is essential. Physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy should begin at the time of diagnosis. Appropriate musculoskeletal support and treatment for prevention of scoliosis-related complications is indicated. Surveillance: Includes routine monitoring of growth, nutritional status and safety of oral intake, seizure control, developmental progress and educational needs, respiratory function and aspiration risk, and the spine and degree of scoliosis.

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics An acute porphyria attack is characterized by a urine porphobilinogen (PBG)-to-creatinine ratio 10 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) and the presence of 2 porphyria manifestations (involving the visceral, peripheral, autonomic, and/or central nervous systems) persisting for >24 hours in the absence of other likely explanations. Onset of acute attacks typically occurs in the second or third decade of life. Acute attacks are more common in women than men. Although attacks in most individuals are typically caused by exposure to certain endogenous or exogenous factors, often no precipitating factor can be identified. The course of acute porphyria attacks is highly variable in an individual and between individuals. Recovery from acute porphyria attacks may occur within days; however, recovery from severe attacks that are not promptly recognized and treated may take weeks or months. The five categories of acute intermittent porphyria (AIP), caused by a heterozygous HMBS pathogenic variant, are based on the urine PBG-to-creatinine ratio and occurrence of acute attacks. Active (symptomatic) AIP: An individual who has experienced at least one acute attack within the last two years. Symptomatic high excreter: Urine PBG-to-creatinine ratio 4 times ULN and no acute attacks in the last two years but chronic long-standing manifestations of acute porphyria. Asymptomatic high excreter: Urine PBG-to-creatinine ratio 4 times ULN and no acute attacks in the last two years and no porphyria-related manifestations. Asymptomatic AIP: Urine PBG-to-creatinine ratio <4 times ULN and no acute attacks in the last two years but has had 1 acute attack in the past. Latent (inactive) AIP: Urine PBG-to-creatinine ratio <4 times ULN and no acute porphyria-related manifestations to date.

Diagnosis/testing GeneReviews When the diagnosis of an AIP attack is suspected based on clinical findings, establishing the diagnosis begins with biochemical testing. If the urinary concentration of PBG is increased, molecular genetic testing is performed to confirm the diagnosis and/or to facilitate cascade screening of family members. When a multigene panel or genomic testing has identified an HMBS pathogenic variant, the diagnosis of an AIP attack is confirmed when the urinary concentration of PBG is increased. Management Treatment of manifestations: Treat intercurrent infections and other diseases promptly. For mild acute neurovisceral attacks, a high carbohydrate intake, preferably oral. When required, intravenous (IV) fluid may be used for up to 48 hours. IV fluid should contain a minimum of 5% dextrose; the recommendation in most countries is 10% glucose with added sodium (40 mmol) and potassium (20 mmol) given at a rate of 1,000 mL over 12 hours. Note that hypotonic dextrose in water solutions should be avoided because of the risk of hyponatremia. Referral to a porphyria specialist for more detailed clinical advice on treatment of AIP. Targeted therapies: For sporadic acute neurovisceral attacks (i.e., when an individual has experienced one to 3 acute porphyria attacks in any 12-month period in the last two years): IV human hemin is the most effective treatment and may be lifesaving if employed early when neuronal damage is reversible. If the criteria for recurrent attacks are met, Givlaari (givosiran) should be considered, as long-term complications of hemin such as iron overload, phlebitis, and loss of venous access can be avoided. Liver transplantation, as reported from several centers, is curative. Indications include repeated life-threatening acute porphyria attacks and poor quality of life when givosiran is not available or has shown insufficient medical efficacy. Alternative medical therapies to reduce frequency and/or severity of acute attacks when givosiran is not available include suppression of ovulation and prophylactic hemin infusion. Supportive care: To reduce the frequency and/or severity of acute attacks, maintain adequate nutrition and seek timely treatment of systemic illness or infection. Supportive treatment involves pain relief, treatment of hypertension, prevention of nausea and vomiting, prompt treatment of seizures, and maintenance of fluid and electrolyte balance. Combined liver and kidney transplantation can be considered in individuals with AIP who have recurrent acute porphyria attacks and end-stage kidney disease. Surveillance: For all individuals heterozygous for an HMBS pathogenic variant who are older than age 50 years, annual or twice a year hepatic imaging is recommended for early detection of primary liver cancer (PLC), which improves survival. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Individuals with AIP are advised to avoid excessive alcohol consumption, as alcohol upregulates the enzyme ALAS1, the first enzyme of hepatic heme biosynthesis, and thus could be a trigger for acute attacks. In all the acute porphyrias, information on the safety of many drugs and other over-the- counter preparations is incomplete; however, evidence-based guidelines for assessment of drug porphyrogenicity have been published. Evaluation of relatives at risk: It is appropriate to clarify the genetic status of apparently asymptomatic at-risk relatives of an individual with a known HMBS pathogenic variant (regardless of the presence or absence of acute porphyria-related manifestations and/or a highly elevated urine PBG-to-creatinine ratio in that individual) so that those who are heterozygous for the familial HMBS pathogenic variant (and thus at increased risk of developing AIP attacks and PLC) can be identified early and counseled about preventive measures and surveillance. For the same reasons it is also appropriate to try to clarify the genetic status of apparently asymptomatic family members of an individual with a biochemical diagnosis of AIP and an unknown HMBS pathogenic variant by assessing erythrocyte HMBS activity; however, this method is less sensitive and specific than molecular genetic testing. Intermittent Porphyria 3 Pregnancy management: Preconception counseling is recommended to advise women with AIP about the clinical manifestations of porphyria, self-care, preventative measures to avoid exacerbations (i.e., adequate and regular nutrition, rest, and carbohydrate intake for treating mild-to-moderate manifestations), and agents/ circumstances to avoid. Additionally, there is a higher risk for pregnancy-induced hypertensive disorder, gestational diabetes, and fetuses with intrauterine growth restriction. In general, risk ratios are higher among women with AIP who have high lifetime urinary PBG concentrations. Genetic counseling AIP is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. The majority of individuals diagnosed with AIP inherited an HMBS pathogenic variant from one of their parents, who may or may not have experienced manifestations of porphyria. Rarely, individuals diagnosed with AIP have the disorder as the result of a de novo HMBS pathogenic variant. Each child of an individual with an HMBS pathogenic variant has a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant. Because clinical penetrance is low, it is not possible to predict whether offspring who inherit an HMBS pathogenic variant will be symptomatic or, if they are symptomatic, the age of onset, severity, or type of manifestations. However, all individuals who inherit an HMBS pathogenic variant should be counseled about preventive measures and surveillance. Once the familial HMBS pathogenic variant has been identified, prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing for AIP are possible."

This chapter discusses the spectrum of Alexander disease as four forms: neonatal, infantile, juvenile, and adult. The neonatal form begins in the first 30 days after birth with neurologic findings (e.g., hypotonia, hyperexcitability, myoclonus) and/or gastrointestinal manifestations (e.g., gastroesophageal reflux, vomiting, failure to thrive), followed by severe developmental delay and regression, seizures, megalencephaly, and typically death within two years. The infantile form is characterized by variable developmental issues: initially some have delayed or plateauing of acquisition of new skills, followed in some by a loss of gross and fine motor skills and language during in the first decade or in others a slow disease course that spans decades. Seizures, often triggered by illness, may be less frequent/severe than in the neonatal form. The juvenile form typically presents in childhood or adolescence with clinical and imaging features that overlap with the other forms. Manifestations in early childhood are milder than those in the infantile form (e.g., mild language delay may be the only developmental abnormality or, with language acquisition, hypophonia or nasal speech may alter the voice, often prior to appearance of other neurologic features). Vomiting and failure to thrive as well as scoliosis and autonomic dysfunction are common. The adult form is typically characterized by bulbar or pseudobulbar findings (palatal myoclonus, dysphagia, dysphonia, dysarthria or slurred speech), motor/gait abnormalities with pyramidal tract signs (spasticity, hyperreflexia, positive Babinski sign), or cerebellar abnormalities (ataxia, nystagmus, or dysmetria).

To date, most reported individuals with molecularly confirmed Alexander disease have the disorder as the result of a de novo GFAP pathogenic variant; however, familial cases have been reported, including individuals with slowly progressive adult Alexander disease who have an affected parent. Individuals with Alexander disease with significant neurologic and cognitive impairment typically do not reproduce, whereas each child of an adult with slowly progressing Alexander disease has a 50% chance of inheriting the GFAP pathogenic variant. Once the GFAP pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing for Alexander disease are possible."

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics ALK-related neuroblastic tumor susceptibility is characterized by increased risk for neuroblastic tumors including neuroblastomas, ganglioneuroblastomas, and ganglioneuromas. Neuroblastomas are a more malignant tumor and ganglioneuromas a more benign tumor. Depending on the histologic findings, ganglioneuroblastomas can behave in a more aggressive fashion, like neuroblastomas, or in a benign fashion, like ganglioneuromas. The overall penetrance of a germline ALK pathogenic variant is approximately 50%, with the risk for neuroblastic tumor development highest in infancy and decreasing by late childhood. Diagnosis/testing ALK-related neuroblastic tumor susceptibility is established by identification of a heterozygous germline ALK activating pathogenic variant in the tyrosine kinase domain that is known or suspected to cause altered kinase function by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Children who develop neuroblastic tumors should be evaluated and treated by a pediatric oncologist at a pediatric cancer center. Treatment for individuals with neuroblastomas and ganglioneuroblastomas who have a germline ALK activating pathogenic variant is the same standard risk- stratified therapy used to treat all neuroblastoma. Ganglioneuromas are typically removed by surgical resection and require no further therapy. Surveillance: In asymptomatic children and after successful treatment of neuroblastic tumors: abdominal ultrasound and urine catecholamine metabolite levels (homovanillic acid and vanillylmandelic acid) every three months and physical examination and chest radiograph every six months between birth and age six years; physical examination, abdominal ultrasound, and measurement of urine catecholamine metabolite levels every Author Affiliations: 1 University of Minnesota Masonic Children's Hospital, Minneapolis, Minnesota; Email: emilyg@umn.edu. 2 St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee; Email: melissa.perrino@stjude.org. 3 Seattle Children's Hospital, Seattle, Washington; Email: julie.park@stjude.org.

Evaluation of relatives at risk: It is appropriate to test relatives at risk (e.g., sibs age <10 years at the time of diagnosis of the proband, as well as sibs born subsequently) for the ALK pathogenic variant found in the proband to identify those for whom early detection of neuroblastomas and initiation of therapy would likely improve quality of life and possibly affect outcome (if therapy is started prior to end organ damage). Genetic counseling ALK-related neuroblastic tumor susceptibility is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Some individuals diagnosed with ALK-related neuroblastic susceptibility inherited a pathogenic variant from a heterozygous parent. Because of reduced penetrance, a parent may have a germline ALK activating pathogenic variant without having developed a neuroblastic tumor. Some individuals diagnosed with ALK-related neuroblastic tumor susceptibility have the disorder as the result of a de novo germline activating pathogenic variant; the proportion of probands who have a de novo pathogenic variant is unknown. Each child of an individual with ALK-related neuroblastic tumor susceptibility has a 50% chance of inheriting the ALK pathogenic variant. The likelihood that a child who inherits the pathogenic variant will develop a neuroblastic tumor is unknown, though the penetrance is estimated to be around 50%. Once the germline ALK activating pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, genetic testing of at-risk asymptomatic relatives and prenatal/ preimplantation genetic testing are possible."

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Alkaptonuria is caused by deficiency of homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase, an enzyme that converts homogentisic acid (HGA) to maleylacetoacetic acid in the tyrosine degradation pathway. The three major features of alkaptonuria are dark urine or urine that turns dark on standing, ochronosis (bluish-black pigmentation in connective tissue), and arthritis of the spine and larger joints. Ochronosis generally occurs after age 30 years; arthritis often begins in the third decade. Other manifestations can include pigment in the sclera, ear cartilage, and skin of the hands; aortic or mitral valve calcification or regurgitation and occasionally aortic dilatation; renal stones; prostate stones; and hypothyroidism. Diagnosis/testing The biochemical diagnosis of alkaptonuria in a proband is based on the detection of a significant amount of HGA in the urine (usually 1 to 8 grams per day). The molecular diagnosis (needed to provide genetic counseling to family members) is based on identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in HGD. Management Treatment of manifestations: Symptomatic management of joint pain is tailored to the individual; physical and occupational therapy help promote optimal muscle strength and flexibility; knee, hip, and shoulder replacements are options when needed; surgical intervention for prostate stones and renal stones as needed; aortic stenosis may necessitate valve replacement; thyroid hormone replacement. Treatment with nitisinone, which has been shown to slow the progression of symptoms, is approved for use in treatment of alkaptonuria in Europe but not the United States.

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics POLG-related disorders comprise a continuum of overlapping phenotypes that were clinically defined before the molecular basis was known. POLG-related disorders can therefore be considered an overlapping spectrum of disease presenting from early childhood to late adulthood. The age of onset broadly correlates with the clinical phenotype. In individuals with early-onset disease (prior to age 12 years), liver involvement, feeding difficulties, seizures, hypotonia, and muscle weakness are the most common clinical features. This group has the worst prognosis. In the juvenile/adult-onset form (age 12-40 years), disease is typically characterized by peripheral neuropathy, ataxia, seizures, stroke-like episodes, and, in individuals with longer survival, progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO). This group generally has a better prognosis than the early-onset group. Late-onset disease (after age 40 years) is characterized by ptosis and PEO, with additional features such as peripheral neuropathy, ataxia, and muscle weakness. This group overall has the best prognosis. Diagnosis/testing Establishing the diagnosis of a POLG-related disorder relies on clinical findings and the identification of biallelic POLG pathogenic variants on molecular genetic testing for all phenotypes except autosomal dominant progressive external ophthalmoplegia (adPEO), for which identification of a heterozygous POLG pathogenic variant on molecular genetic testing is diagnostic.

Management GeneReviews Treatment of manifestations: Clinical management is largely supportive and involves standard approaches for associated complications including occupational, physical, and speech therapy; nutritional support; respiratory support; and standard treatment of liver failure, epilepsy, movement abnormalities, sleep disorders, vision, and hearing issues. Surveillance: Evaluations by a multidisciplinary team of health care providers based on clinical findings; routine evaluation of growth, nutrition, oral intake, and respiratory status; monitoring of liver enzymes every three months or as clinically indicated; monitoring of epilepsy with repeat liver function tests after introduction of any new anti-seizure medication. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Valproic acid (Depakene) and sodium divalproate (divalproex) (Depakote) because of the risk of precipitating and/or accelerating liver disease. Genetic counseling Early-onset and juvenile/adult-onset POLG-related disorders are typically caused by biallelic pathogenic variants and inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Late-onset PEO may be caused by a heterozygous POLG pathogenic variant and inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Autosomal recessive inheritance: If both parents are known to be heterozygous for a POLG pathogenic variant, each sib of an affected individual has at conception a 25% chance of inheriting biallelic pathogenic variants and being affected, a 50% chance of being heterozygous, and a 25% chance of inheriting neither of the familial POLG pathogenic variants. Heterozygous sibs of a proband with an autosomal recessive POLG-related disorder are typically asymptomatic. Once the POLG pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member, testing for at-risk family members is possible. Autosomal dominant inheritance: Most individuals with PEO caused by a heterozygous POLG pathogenic variant (i.e., adPEO) have an affected parent, although age of onset and severity of presentation can vary greatly from generation to generation. Each child of an individual with POLG-related adPEO has a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant.

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) can present with hepatic dysfunction in individuals from infancy to adulthood and with chronic obstructive lung disease (emphysema and/or bronchiectasis), characteristically in individuals older than age 30 years. Individuals with AATD are also at increased risk for panniculitis (migratory, inflammatory, tender skin nodules which may ulcerate on legs and lower abdomen) and C-ANCA-positive vasculitis (granulomatosis with polyangiitis). Phenotypic expression varies within and between families. In adults, smoking is the major factor in accelerating the development of COPD; nonsmokers may have a normal life span, but can also develop lung and/or liver disease. Although reported, emphysema in children with AATD is extremely rare. AATD-associated liver disease, which is present in only a small portion of affected children, manifests as neonatal cholestasis. The incidence of liver disease increases with age. Liver disease in adults (manifesting as cirrhosis and fibrosis) may occur in the absence of a history of neonatal or childhood liver disease. The risk for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is increased in individuals with AATD. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of AATD relies on demonstration of low serum concentration of alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) and either identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in SERPINA1 or detection of a functionally deficient AAT protein variant by protease inhibitor (PI) typing. Note: The unconventional nomenclature of SERPINA1 alleles is based on electrophoretic protein variants that were identified long before the gene (SERPINA1) was known. Alleles were named with the prefix PI* (protease inhibitor*) serving as an alias for the gene. Using this nomenclature, the most common (normal) allele is PI*M and the most common pathogenic allele is PI*Z. Management Treatment of manifestations: COPD is treated with standard therapy.

Lung transplantation may be an appropriate option for individuals with end-stage lung disease. Liver transplantation is the definitive treatment for severe disease (will restore AAT levels). Dapsone or doxycycline therapy is used for panniculitis; if refractory to this, high-dose intravenous AAT augmentation therapy is indicated. Surveillance: Every six to 12 months: pulmonary function tests including spirometry with bronchodilators and diffusing capacity measurements; liver function tests, platelet count and liver ultrasound, elastography (e.g., FibroScan), magnetic resonance imaging. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Smoking (both active and passive); occupational exposure to environmental pollutants used in agriculture, mineral dust, gas, and fumes; excessive use of alcohol. Evaluation of relatives at risk: Evaluation of parents, older and younger sibs, and offspring of an individual with severe AATD in order to identify as early as possible those relatives who would benefit from institution of treatment and preventive measures. Genetic counseling AATD is inherited in an autosomal codominant manner. If both parents are heterozygous for one SERPINA1 pathogenic variant (e.g., PI*MZ), each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being affected (PI*ZZ), a 50% chance of being heterozygous (PI*MZ), and a 25% chance of inheriting neither of the pathogenic variants (PI*MM). In the less frequent instance in which one parent is homozygous (PI*ZZ) and one parent is heterozygous (PI*MZ), the risk to each sib of being homozygous (PI*ZZ) is 50%. Unless an individual with AATD has children with an affected individual or a heterozygote, offspring will be obligate heterozygotes for a pathogenic variant. (Risk of lung disease may be increased in heterozygous individuals depending on their environmental exposures such as smoking.) Heterozygote testing for at-risk family members and prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing are possible once the pathogenic SERPINA1 variants have been identified in the family."

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics In Alport syndrome (AS) a spectrum of phenotypes ranging from progressive renal disease with extrarenal abnormalities to isolated hematuria with a non-progressive or very slowly progressive course is observed. Approximately two thirds of AS is X-linked (XLAS); approximately 15% is autosomal recessive (ARAS), and approximately 20% is autosomal dominant (ADAS). In the absence of treatment, renal disease progresses from microscopic hematuria (microhematuria) to proteinuria, progressive renal insufficiency, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in all males with XLAS, and in all males and females with ARAS. Progressive sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) is usually present by late childhood or early adolescence. Ocular findings include anterior lenticonus (which is virtually pathognomonic), maculopathy (whitish or yellowish flecks or granulations in the perimacular region), corneal endothelial vesicles (posterior polymorphous dystrophy), and recurrent corneal erosion. In individuals with ADAS, ESRD is frequently delayed until later adulthood, SNHL is relatively late in onset, and ocular involvement is rare. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of Alport syndrome is established in a proband with a pathogenic variant(s) in COL4A3, COL4A4, or COL4A5 identified on molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker to delay onset of ESRD; routine treatment of hypertension; renal transplantation for ESRD. Potential living related donors must be evaluated carefully to avoid nephrectomy in an affected individual. Routine treatment of SNHL and cataracts; surgical intervention for symptomatic leiomyomas. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Protection of corneas from minor trauma in those with recurrent corneal erosions. Minimize exposure to loud noise.

GeneReviews Surveillance: Follow up of all individuals with Alport syndrome with a nephrologist every six to 12 months; monthly monitoring of at-risk transplant recipients for development of anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody-mediated glomerulonephritis for the first year post transplant; audiologic evaluation of children every one to two years beginning at age six to seven years; monitoring for ocular abnormalities; evaluation for aortic dilatation (for males with XLAS). Evaluation of relatives at risk: Evaluate at-risk family members either by urinalysis or, if the pathogenic variant(s) in the family are known, by molecular genetic testing. Genetic counseling Three modes of inheritance are recognized for Alport syndrome: X-linked, autosomal recessive, and autosomal dominant. In families with X-linked inheritance, mothers heterozygous for a COL4A5 pathogenic variant have a 50% chance of transmitting the pathogenic variant in each pregnancy; sons who inherit the pathogenic variant will be affected with Alport syndrome and will eventually develop ESRD and, in most cases, deafness; daughters who inherit the pathogenic variant will typically have asymptomatic hematuria but may have more severe renal disease. Affected males will pass the pathogenic variant to all of their daughters and none of their sons. In families with autosomal recessive inheritance, the parents of an affected child are obligate heterozygotes and carry one pathogenic variant; at conception, each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being a carrier who may or may not be symptomatic, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. In families with autosomal dominant inheritance, each child of an affected individual has a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant and being affected. In rare Alport families with digenic inheritance (pathogenic variants in two or more of the COL4A3, COL4A4, and COL4A5 genes), transmission patterns may not conform to mendelian expectations. Molecular genetic testing for at-risk family members, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk, and preimplantation genetic testing are possible if the pathogenic variant(s) in the family are known."

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS), caused by defective lymphocyte homeostasis, is characterized by the following: Non-malignant lymphoproliferation (lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly with or without hypersplenism) that often improves with age Autoimmune disease, mostly directed toward blood cells Lifelong increased risk for both Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma In ALPS-FAS (the most common and best-characterized type of ALPS, associated with heterozygous germline pathogenic variants in FAS), non-malignant lymphoproliferation typically manifests in the first years of life, inexplicably waxes and wanes, and then often decreases without treatment in the second decade of life; in many affected individuals, however, neither splenomegaly nor the overall expansion of lymphocyte subsets in peripheral blood decreases. Although autoimmunity is often not present at the time of diagnosis or at the time of the most extensive lymphoproliferation, autoantibodies can be detected before autoimmune disease manifests clinically. In ALPS-FAS caused by homozygous or compound heterozygous (biallelic) pathogenic variants in FAS, severe lymphoproliferation occurs before, at, or shortly after birth, and usually results in death at an early age. ALPS-sFAS, resulting from somatic FAS pathogenic variants in selected cell populations, notably the alpha/beta double-negative T cells (/-DNT cells), appears to be similar to ALPS-FAS resulting from heterozygous germline pathogenic variants in FAS, although lower incidence of splenectomy and lower lymphocyte counts have been reported in ALPS-sFAS and no cases of lymphoma have yet been published.

Copyright 1993-2024, University of Washington, Seattle. GeneReviews is a registered trademark of the University of Washington, Seattle. All rights reserved. GeneReviews Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of ALPS is based on the following: Clinical findings Laboratory abnormalities: Abnormal biomarker testing (soluble interleukin-10 [IL-10], Fas ligand [FasL], IL-18, and vitamin B12) Defective in vitro tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 6 (Fas)-mediated apoptosis T cells that express the alpha/beta T-cell receptor but lack both CD4 and CD8 (so-called \\\"/-DNT cells\\\") Identification of pathogenic variants in genes relevant for the Fas pathway of apoptosis. These genes include FAS (either germline or somatic pathogenic variants), CASP10, and FASGL. Up to 20% of those with clinical ALPS have not had a genetic etiology identified. Management Treatment of manifestations: Current management is focused on monitoring for and treatment of lymphoproliferation, hypersplensim, and lymphomas and management of cytopenias and other autoimmune diseases. Corticosteroids and immunosuppressive therapy do not decrease lymphadenopathy long term and are generally reserved for severe complications of lymphoproliferation (e.g., airway obstruction, significant hypersplenism associated with splenomegaly) and/or autoimmune manifestations. Experience with sirolimus suggests that it is the preferred agent in treating lymphoproliferation in a more sustained manner, including maintenance of remission following a period of discontinued use of sirolimus; however, sirolimus is not without side effects. Lymphoma is treated with conventional protocols. Autoimmune cytopenias and other autoimmune diseases are typically treated by immune suppression with corticosteroids as well as corticosteroid-sparing agents if prolonged treatment of autoimmune cytopenias is required and/or in cases of refractory cytopenias. Splenectomy is reserved as an option of last resort in the treatment of life-threatening refractory cytopenias and/or severe hypersplenia because of the high risk of recurrence of cytopenias and sepsis post-splenectomy in persons with ALPS. Prevention of primary manifestations: Bone marrow (hematopoietic stem cell) transplantation (BMT/HSCT), the only curative treatment for ALPS, has to date mostly been performed on those with severe clinical phenotypes such as ALPS-FAS caused by biallelic pathogenic variants, those with severe and/or refractory autoimmune cytopenias, those with lymphoma, and those who have developed complications from (often long-term) immunosuppressive therapy. Prevention of secondary complications: Vaccinations pre-splenectomy (with consideration of post-splenectomy boost vaccinations) and penicillin prophylaxis are strongly recommended for individuals who undergo splenectomy. Surveillance: Clinical assessment and imaging and laboratory studies for manifestations of lymphoproliferation and autoimmunity; specialized imaging studies to detect malignant transformation. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Splenectomy is discouraged as it typically does not lead to permanent remission of autoimmunity and is associated with increased risk of infection. Aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drugs should be used with caution in individuals with immune thrombocytopenia as they can interfere with platelet function. Lymphoproliferative Syndrome 3 Evaluation of relatives at risk: If the pathogenic variant(s) have been identified in a family member with ALPS, it is appropriate to perform molecular genetic testing on at-risk relatives to allow for early diagnosis and treatment. Pregnancy management: Assessment of the risks and benefits of treating a woman who has ALPS with corticosteroids, mycophenylate mofitil, or sirolimus during pregnancy must take into consideration the potential teratogenic risks to the fetus. Genetic counseling Inheritance of ALPS-CASP10, most cases of ALPS-FAS, and some cases of ALPS-FASLG is autosomal dominant. Each child of an individual with autosomal dominant ALPS has a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant. Inheritance of most cases of ALPS-FASLG and severe ALPS associated with biallelic FAS pathogenic variants is autosomal recessive. The parents of an individual with autosomal recessive ALPS are likely to be heterozygotes, in which case each has one FAS pathogenic variant; these parents may have ALPS-related findings or may be clinically asymptomatic. Prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk is possible if the pathogenic variant(s) have been identified in an affected family member. ALPS-FAS can also be the result of somatic mosaicism. Somatic pathogenic variants have not been reported in ALPS-FASLG or ALPS-CASP10 to date."

Cone-rod dystrophy presents as progressive visual impairment, photophobia, and nystagmus usually starting between birth and age 15 months. Many individuals lose all perception of light by the end of the second decade, but a minority retain the ability to read large print into the third decade. Children usually have normal birth weight but develop truncal obesity during their first year. Sensorineural hearing loss presents in the first decade in as many as 70% of individuals and may progress to the severe or moderately severe range (40-70 db) by the end of the first to second decade. Insulin resistance is typically accompanied by the skin changes of acanthosis nigricans, and proceeds to T2DM in the majority by the third decade. Nearly all demonstrate hypertriglyceridemia. Other findings can include endocrine abnormalities (hypothyroidism, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism in males, and hyperandrogenism in females), urologic dysfunction / detrusor instability, progressive decrease in renal function, and hepatic disease (ranging from elevated transaminases to steatohepatitis/NAFLD). Approximately 20% of affected individuals have delay in early developmental milestones, most commonly in gross and fine motor skills. About 30% have a learning disability. Cognitive impairment (IQ <70) is very rare. Wide clinical variability is observed among affected individuals, even within the same family.

Diagnosis/testing GeneReviews The clinical diagnosis of Alstrm syndrome is based on cardinal clinical features that emerge throughout infancy, childhood, and young adulthood. The molecular diagnosis of Alstrm syndrome is established in individuals of all ages by identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in ALMS1 on molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: No therapy exists to prevent the progressive organ involvement of Alstrm syndrome. Individuals with Alstrm syndrome require coordinated multidisciplinary care to formulate management and therapeutic interventions. Red-orange tinted prescription lenses may reduce symptoms of photodysphoria; early educational planning should be based on the certainty of blindness. Obesity and insulin resistance are managed by a healthful, reduced-calorie diet with restricted simple carbohydrate intake and regular aerobic exercise. Myringotomy and/or hearing aids as needed for hearing impairment. Standard therapy for heart failure / cardiomyopathy. Standard treatment of insulin resistance / T2DM as in the general population. Consider nicotinic acid derivatives for hyperlipidemia; consultation with an endocrinologist if pubertal development and/or menses are abnormal; urinary diversion or self-catheterization in those with voiding difficulties; renal transplantation has been successful in a number of cases; appropriate therapy for portal hypertension and esophageal varices. Surveillance: Routine assessment of vision and hearing; weight, height, and body mass index; heart (including echocardiography and EKG in all individuals, and MRI in those age >18 years); postprandial c-peptide and glucose and HbA1C starting at age four years; lipid profile; plasma ALT, AST, and GGT concentrations; thyroid function. Twice-yearly CBC, electrolytes, BUN, creatinine, cystatin-C, uric acid, urinalysis. Renal and bladder ultrasound examinations every one to two years if symptomatic and/or if urinalysis is abnormal. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Any substance contraindicated in persons with renal, hepatic, and/or myocardial disease. Therapy directed at one system may have adverse effects on other systems; for example, the use of glitazone therapy in diabetes mellitus is contraindicated in the presence of cardiac failure. Evaluation of relatives at risk: It is appropriate to clarify the genetic status of apparently asymptomatic older and younger at-risk sibs of an individual with Alstrm syndrome in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from prompt evaluation for manifestations of Alstrm syndrome, initiation of treatment, and/or surveillance for age-related manifestations.

Clinical characteristics Alzheimer disease (AD) is characterized by adult-onset progressive dementia associated with cerebral cortical atrophy, beta-amyloid plaque formation, and intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles. AD typically begins with subtle memory failure that becomes more severe and is eventually incapacitating. Other common findings include confusion, poor judgment, language disturbance, agitation, withdrawal, hallucinations, seizures, Parkinsonian features, increased muscle tone, myoclonus, incontinence, and mutism. Familial AD (FAD) characterizes families that have more than one member with AD and usually implies multiple affected persons in more than one generation. Early-onset FAD (EOFAD) refers to families in which onset is consistently before age 60 to 65 years and often before age 55 years. Diagnosis/testing EOFAD is diagnosed in families with multiple affected individuals with mean age of onset before 65 years and/or with a documented pathogenic variant in one of the genes known to be associated with EOFAD. The three clinically indistinguishable subtypes of EOFAD based on the underlying genetic mechanism are: Alzheimer disease type 1 (AD1), caused by mutation of APP (10%-15% of EOFAD); Alzheimer disease type 3 (AD3), caused by mutation of PSEN1, (30%-70% of EOFAD); and Alzheimer disease type 4 (AD4), caused by mutation of PSEN2 (<5% of EOFAD). Kindreds with autosomal dominant EOFAD with no identifiable pathogenic variants in PSEN1, PSEN2, or APP have been described; thus, it is likely that variants in additional genes are causative.

Management GeneReviews Treatment of manifestations: Supportive; symptoms of depression, aggression, sleep disturbance, seizures, and hallucinations are managed on an individual basis; affected individuals eventually require assisted living/nursing home care; agents that increase cholinergic activity, such as Aricept (donepezil), Exelon (rivastigmine), and Reminy (galatamine), show modest but variable benefit; memantine, an NMDA receptor antagonist, is approved for use in AD; physical and occupational therapy help manage activities of daily living. Surveillance: Monthly monitoring to identify and manage secondary complications. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Sudden changes in environment; over-sedation. Genetic counseling EOFAD is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Most individuals with EOFAD had an affected parent; occasionally, neither parent is identified as having had the disease, but a second-degree relative (e.g., an uncle, aunt, and/or grandparent) has or had EOFAD. Each child of an individual with EOFAD has a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant and developing EOFAD. Prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk for is possible if the pathogenic variant in the family is known; however, prenatal testing for adult-onset disorders is uncommon."

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics SCARB2-related action myoclonus renal failure syndrome (SCARB2-AMRF) comprises a continuum of two major (and ultimately fatal) manifestations: progressive myoclonic epilepsy (PME) and renal involvement that is apparently due to steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS). The neurologic and renal manifestations progress independently. In some instances, renal involvement is not observed; thus, PME without renal manifestations caused by biallelic SCARB2 pathogenic variants is considered to be one end of the spectrum of SCARB2-AMRF. All individuals reported to date developed neurologic findings; in some instances renal manifestations predated neurologic involvement by decades. The disease progresses relentlessly, with neurologic deterioration (especially increasing severity of myoclonus) and/or end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) leading to death within seven to 15 years after onset. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of SCARB2-AMRF is established in a proband with suggestive findings and biallelic loss-of- function pathogenic variants in SCARB2 identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: There is no cure for SCARB2-AMRF. The supportive care for neurologic manifestations that is recommended to improve quality of life, maximize function, and reduce complications includes pharmacotherapy to reduce myoclonus; anti-seizure medication (ASM) and vagus nerve stimulation to reduce seizures; physical and occupational therapy to help maintain mobility and optimize activities of daily living; adaptive devices to help maintain/improve independence in mobility; educational support for those with cognitive decline; speech-language therapy to explore use of Author Affiliations: 1 National Human Genome Research Institute, Bethesda, Maryland; Email: changrx@hs.uci.edu; Email: toroc@mail.nih.gov. 2 Department of Neurology, University of California Irvine, Orange, California; Email: changrx@hs.uci.edu. 3 Stanford University School of Medicine, Palo Alto, California; Email: hcahn@stanford.edu; Email: skibrom@stanford.edu.

GeneReviews alternative communication methods; feeding therapy programs for those with dysphagia to improve nutrition and reduce aspiration risk. Treatment for renal involvement, under the care of a nephrologist, is typically focused on remission of proteinuria and often includes a combination of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone inhibition and immunosuppressive medications. Treatment of ESKD is supportive; while renal replacement therapy can prolong survival, it does not improve neurologic features. Surveillance: Regular follow up with multidisciplinary care providers to monitor existing manifestations, the individual's response to supportive care, and the emergence of new manifestations. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Phenytoin may aggravate neurologic manifestations or even accelerate cerebellar degeneration; sodium channel blockers (carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine), GABAergic drugs (tiagabine, vigabatrin), and gabapentin and pregabalin may aggravate myoclonus and myoclonic seizures. Pregnancy management: Some ASMs can increase the risk of malformations, growth restriction, and/or neurodevelopmental disabilities in exposed fetuses. However, when pregnant women experience prolonged seizures during pregnancy, the risk of adverse fetal outcomes is increased. Therefore, it is recommended that pregnant women with a known seizure disorder continue to take ASMs and that the prescribing physician follow standard measures to prevent fetopathy, including possible changes of medication prior to pregnancy; spacing of ASMs during pregnancy into four doses a day or taking extended-release medications, so that ASM levels do not have significant peaks or troughs; monitoring ASM dosages and levels during pregnancy. In addition, all women of childbearing age should be advised to take 1 mg/day of folic acid and to increase it to 4 mg/day when planning a pregnancy (ideally three months prior to conception) and during the pregnancy, in order to reduce the risk of congenital malformations that can be associated with fetal exposure to ASMs. Genetic counseling SCARB2-AMRF is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. If both parents are known to be heterozygous for a SCARB2 pathogenic variant, each sib of an affected individual has at conception a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Once the SCARB2 pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member, carrier testing for at- risk relatives and prenatal/preimplantation genetic testing are possible."

AIS represents a spectrum of defects in androgen action and can be subdivided into three broad phenotypes: Complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS), with typical female external genitalia Partial androgen insensitivity syndrome (PAIS) with predominantly female, predominantly male, or ambiguous external genitalia Mild androgen insensitivity syndrome (MAIS) with typical male external genitalia Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of AIS is established in an individual with a 46,XY karyotype who has: undermasculinization of the external genitalia, impaired spermatogenesis with otherwise normal testes, absent or rudimentary mllerian structures, evidence of normal or increased synthesis of testosterone and its normal conversion to dihydrotestosterone, and normal or increased luteinizing hormone (LH) production by the pituitary gland; AND/OR a hemizygous pathogenic variant in AR identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: To prevent testicular malignancy, treatment of CAIS may include either removal of the testes after puberty when feminization is complete or prepubertal gonadectomy accompanied by estrogen replacement therapy. Because the risk of malignancy is low, however, removal of gonads is increasingly controversial. Additional treatment for CAIS may include vaginal dilation to avoid dyspareunia.

GeneReviews PAIS in individuals with predominantly female genitalia is similar to treatment of CAIS, but is more likely to include prepubertal gonadectomy to help avoid increasing clitoromegaly at the time of puberty. In individuals with PAIS and ambiguous or predominantly male genitalia, the tendency has been for parents and health care professionals to assign sex of rearing after an expert evaluation has been completed. Those individuals with PAIS who are raised as males may undergo urologic surgery such as orchiopexy and hypospadias repair. Those individuals with PAIS who are raised as females and who undergo gonadectomy after puberty may need combined estrogen and androgen replacement therapy. Males with MAIS may require mammoplasty for gynecomastia. A trial of androgen pharmacotherapy may help improve virilization in infancy. It is best if the diagnosis of AIS is explained to the affected individual and family in an empathic environment, with both professional and family support. Prevention of secondary manifestations: Regular weight-bearing exercises and supplemental calcium and vitamin D are recommended to optimize bone health; bisphosphonate therapy may be indicated for those with evidence of decreased bone mineral density and/or multiple fractures. Surveillance: Periodic reevaluation for gynecomastia during puberty in individuals assigned a male sex; monitoring of bone mineral density through DXA scanning in adults. Evaluation of relatives at risk: For an apparently asymptomatic older or younger sib who has normal external female genitalia and who has not yet undergone menarche, a karyotype can be done first. For those phenotypic females who have a 46,XY karyotype, molecular genetic testing for the known AR variant in the family can be pursued next. If the AR variant in the family is not known, androgen binding assays could be considered. Genetic counseling AIS is inherited in an X-linked manner. Affected 46,XY individuals are almost always infertile. Each offspring of a female known to carry an AR pathogenic variant (heterozygote) is at a 25% risk for each of the following: Having a 46,XY karyotype and being affected Having a 46,XY karyotype and being unaffected Having a 46,XX karyotype and being a carrier Having a 46,XX karyotype and not being a carrier Carrier testing for at-risk relatives and prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk are possible if the pathogenic variant in the family is known."

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Angelman syndrome (AS) is characterized by severe developmental delay or intellectual disability, severe speech impairment, gait ataxia and/or tremulousness of the limbs, and unique behavior with an apparent happy demeanor that includes frequent laughing, smiling, and excitability. Microcephaly and seizures are also common. Developmental delays are first noted at around age six months; however, the unique clinical features of AS do not become manifest until after age one year. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of AS is established in a proband who meets the consensus clinical diagnostic criteria and/or who has findings on molecular genetic testing that suggest deficient expression or function of the maternally inherited UBE3A allele. Analysis of parent-specific DNA methylation imprints in the 15q11.2-q13 chromosome region detects approximately 80% of individuals with AS, including those with a deletion, uniparental disomy, or an imprinting defect; fewer than 1% of individuals have a cytogenetically visible chromosome rearrangement (e.g., translocation or inversion). UBE3A sequence analysis detects pathogenic variants in an additional approximately 11% of individuals. Therefore, molecular genetic testing (methylation analysis and UBE3A sequence analysis) identifies alterations in approximately 90% of individuals. The remaining 10% of individuals with classic phenotypic features of AS have the disorder as a result of an as-yet unidentified genetic mechanism. Management Treatment of manifestations: Anti-seizure medication for seizures. Accommodation for hypermotoric behaviors and disruptive nighttime wakefulness. Behavior modification can be effective for disruptive or self-injurious behaviors.

Less commonly, an individual with AS has the disorder as the result of a genetic alteration associated with an imprinting pattern of autosomal dominant inheritance or variable recurrence risk. Reliable recurrence risk assessment therefore requires identification of the underlying genetic mechanism in the proband and confirmation of the genetic status of the parents. Prenatal detection of all the known molecular genetic alterations in the 15q11.2-q13 region that give rise to AS is possible and is an option for families once the underlying genetic mechanism in the proband has been identified."

Aniridia is a pan ocular disorder affecting the cornea, iris, intraocular pressure (resulting in glaucoma), lens (cataract and lens subluxation), fovea (foveal hypoplasia), and optic nerve (optic nerve coloboma and hypoplasia). Individuals with aniridia characteristically show nystagmus and impaired visual acuity (usually 20/100 - 20/200); however, milder forms of aniridia with subtle iris architecture changes, good vision, and normal foveal structure do occur. Other ocular involvement may include strabismus and occasionally microphthalmia. Although the severity of aniridia can vary between and within families, little variability is usually observed in the two eyes of an affected individual. WAGR syndrome. The risk for Wilms tumor is 42.5%-77%; of those who develop Wilms tumor, 90% do so by age four years and 98% by age seven years. Genital anomalies in males can include cryptorchidism and hypospadias (sometimes resulting in ambiguous genitalia), urethral strictures, ureteric abnormalities, and gonadoblastoma. While females typically have normal external genitalia, they may have uterine abnormalities and streak ovaries. Intellectual disability (defined as IQ <74) is observed in 70%; behavioral abnormalities include attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder, anxiety, depression, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Other individuals with WAGR syndrome can have normal intellect without behavioral issues.

Correction of refractive errors, use of tinted or photochromic lenses to reduce light sensitivity, occlusion therapy in childhood for amblyopia, use of low-vision aids. Treatment of severe cataracts requires attention to potential complications caused by poor zonular stability. Glaucoma: Initial treatment is usually topical anti-glaucoma medication; surgery is reserved for eyes that do not respond to medical therapy. Ocular surface disease: medical treatment (lubricants, mucolytics, and punctal occlusion) may help slow the progression of corneal opacification. When corneal opacification causes significant visual reduction, penetrating keratoplasty with limbal stem cell transplantation may be considered; however, this has a high risk of failure and possible lifelong systemic immunosuppression to prevent rejection. WAGR syndrome. Wilms tumor, genital anomalies, and developmental delay / intellectual disability are managed as per standard practice. Surveillance: Aniridia. Monitor children younger than age eight years every four to six months for refractive errors and detection and treatment of incipient or actual amblyopia; annual ophthalmology follow up of all individuals to detect issues such as corneal changes, raised intraocular pressure, and cataracts. WAGR syndrome. Children with aniridia and a WT1 deletion require renal ultrasound examinations every three months and follow up by a pediatric oncologist until age eight years. Because of the increased risk for renal impairment in WAGR syndrome (especially in those with bilateral Wilms tumor), lifelong evaluation of renal function is recommended. Developmental progress and educational needs require regular monitoring. Behavioral assessment for anxiety, ADHD, and aggressive or self-injurious behavior as needed. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Intraocular surgery may increase the likelihood of (or exacerbate existing) keratopathy; repeated intraocular surgery predisposes to severe aniridic fibrosis syndrome. Evaluation of relatives at risk: Early clarification of the genetic status of infants who are offspring or sibs of an individual with PAX6-related isolated aniridia (by either an eye examination or molecular genetic testing for the PAX6 variant in the family) is recommended in order to identify those who would benefit from prompt treatment and surveillance of complications of aniridia. Genetic counseling Isolated aniridia and WAGR syndrome are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Isolated aniridia. ~70% of individuals have an affected parent; ~30% have a de novo PAX6 pathogenic variant or deletion of a regulatory region controlling PAX6 expression. Each child of an individual with isolated aniridia has a 50% chance of inheriting the causative genetic alteration and developing aniridia. In rare instances of mosaicism for the PAX6 pathogenic variant in the proband, the risk to offspring may be lower. Aniridia 3 WAGR syndrome is associated with contiguous-gene deletions including PAX6 and WT1. If the proband has a de novo contiguous-gene deletion and neither parent has evidence of mosaicism for the deletion, the risk to sibs is no greater than that in the general population. When the PAX6 genetic alteration in a family is known, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible."

The most typical presentation is limb- girdle muscular dystrophy type 2L (LGMD2L) with late-onset proximal lower-limb weakness in the fourth or fifth decade (range 15-70 years). Less common is Miyoshi-like disease (Miyoshi muscular dystrophy 3) with early-adult-onset calf distal myopathy (around age 20 years). Incidental hyperCKemia may be present even earlier. Initial symptoms are walking difficulties, reduced sports performance, and difficulties in standing on toes as well as nonspecific exercise myalgia and/or burning sensation in the calf muscles. Muscle weakness and atrophy are frequently asymmetric. Cardiac findings can include cardiomyopathy and arrhythmias and/or left ventricular dysfunction. Bulbar or respiratory symptoms have not been reported. Females have milder disease manifestations than males. Disease progression is slow in both the LGMD and distal forms; ambulation is preserved until very late in the disease course. Life span is normal. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of ANO5 muscle disease is established in a proband with identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in ANO5 on molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: No definitive treatments for the limb-girdle muscular dystrophies exist. Management is tailored to the individual. To assist with decreased mobility, the following are suggested: weight control to avoid obesity, physical therapy to promote mobility and prevent contractures, and use of mechanical aids to help ambulation and mobility.

Other typical findings are ulnar deviation of the fingers, gap between the first and second toes, and clubfoot. SLC26A2-related atelosteogenesis is usually lethal at birth or shortly thereafter due to pulmonary hypoplasia and tracheobronchomalacia.

Clinical characteristics Ataxia with oculomotor apraxia type 1 (AOA1) is characterized by childhood onset of slowly progressive cerebellar ataxia, followed by oculomotor apraxia and a severe primary motor peripheral axonal motor neuropathy. The first manifestation is progressive gait imbalance (mean age of onset: 4.3 years; range: 2-10 years), followed by dysarthria, then upper-limb dysmetria with mild intention tremor. Oculomotor apraxia, usually noticed a few years after the onset of ataxia, progresses to external ophthalmoplegia. All affected individuals have generalized areflexia followed by a peripheral neuropathy and quadriplegia with loss of ambulation about seven to ten years after onset. Hands and feet are short and atrophic. Chorea and upper-limb dystonia are common. Intellect remains normal in some individuals; in others, different degrees of cognitive impairment have been observed. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of AOA1 is based on clinical findings (including family history) and exclusion of the diagnosis of ataxia-telangiectasia. Cerebellar atrophy is visible on MRI in all affected individuals. EMG reveals axonal neuropathy in 100% of individuals with AOA1. APTX is the only gene known to be associated with AOA1. Management Treatment of manifestations: May include physical therapy, particularly for disabilities resulting from peripheral neuropathy; a wheelchair for mobility, usually by age 15-20 years; educational support for difficulties with speaking, reading, and writing.

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics AP-4-associated hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP), also known as AP-4 deficiency syndrome, is a group of neurodegenerative disorders characterized by a progressive, complex spastic paraplegia with onset typically in infancy or early childhood. Early-onset hypotonia evolves into progressive lower-extremity spasticity. The majority of children become nonambulatory and usually wheelchair bound. Over time spasticity progresses to involve the upper extremities, resulting in a spastic tetraplegia. Associated complications include dysphagia, contractures, foot deformities, dysregulation of bladder and bowel function, and a pseudobulbar affect. About 50% of affected individuals have seizures. Postnatal microcephaly (usually in the -2SD to -3SD range) is common. All have developmental delay. Speech development is significantly impaired and many affected individuals remain nonverbal. Intellectual disability in older children is usually moderate to severe. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of AP-4-associated HSP is established in a proband by identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in one of four genes: AP4B1, AP4E1, AP4M1, or AP4S1. Management Treatment of manifestations: Management by an interdisciplinary team (including a neurologist, clinical geneticist, developmental specialist, orthopedic surgeon/physiatrist, physical therapist, occupational therapist, and a speech and language pathologist) to address spasticity/weakness, secondary musculoskeletal findings, developmental delay and intellectual disability, seizures, and swallowing and feeding difficulties.

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Apert syndrome is characterized by the presence of multisuture craniosynostosis, midface retrusion, and syndactyly of the hands with fusion of the second through fourth nails. Almost all affected individuals have coronal craniosynostosis, and a majority also have involvement of the sagittal and lambdoid sutures. The midface in Apert syndrome is underdeveloped as well as retruded; a subset of affected individuals have cleft palate. The hand in Apert syndrome always includes fusion of the middle three digits; the thumb and fifth finger are sometimes also involved. Feeding issues, dental abnormalities, hearing loss, hyperhidrosis, and progressive synostosis of multiple bones (skull, hands, feet, carpus, tarsus, and cervical vertebrae) are also common. Multilevel airway obstruction may be present and can be due to narrowing of the nasal passages, tongue-based airway obstruction, and/or tracheal anomalies. Nonprogressive ventriculomegaly is present in a majority of individuals, with a small subset having true hydrocephalus. Most individuals with Apert syndrome have normal intelligence or mild intellectual disability; moderate-to-severe intellectual disability has been reported in some individuals. A minority of affected individuals have structural cardiac abnormalities, true gastrointestinal malformations, and anomalies of the genitourinary tract. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of Apert syndrome is established in a proband with classic clinical characteristics (multisuture craniosynostosis, midface retrusion, and syndactyly) and/or by the identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in FGFR2 by molecular genetic testing AND phenotypic features consistent with Apert syndrome. Management Treatment of manifestations: Management by a craniofacial team is ideal. In general, multisutural craniosynostosis should be surgically repaired in the first year of life; jaw surgery to advance the midface often occurs in childhood and adolescence. Cleft palate repair may be performed prior to the development of pressure consonants. Feeding therapy is often helpful. Pediatric dental care is recommended.

GeneReviews should be performed by an ophthalmologist with expertise in eye alignment in children with craniosynostosis. Hearing aids may be required for hearing loss. If airway obstruction is present, temporizing measures may be required. Treatment of sleep apnea by surgical intervention and/or supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula may be required. The type and timing of surgical repair for syndactyly depends on the presence of thumb syndactyly and extent of soft tissue deficiency. Early intervention services for speech abnormalities and developmental delay should be initiated. Standard treatment of congenital heart defects, malrotation, cryptorchidism in males, hydronephrosis, acne, and scoliosis should be instituted when appropriate. Prevention of secondary complications: Timely surgical treatment of craniosynostosis may prevent increased intracranial pressure that can lead to papilledema and cognitive impairment; ocular lubricants to prevent exposure keratopathy and corneal scarring; anesthesia evaluation before any surgical intervention to prevent perioperative respiratory complications; spine precautions and consultation with a spine surgeon to prevent spinal cord injury and neurologic sequelae in those with cervical spine anomalies. Clinical feeding evaluation and/or video fluoroscopic swallow study is needed to determine if precautions are required to prevent aspiration pneumonia and subsequent chronic lung disease. Surveillance: Measurement of head circumference and fontanelle size and assessment for increased intracranial pressure at each appointment in infancy and early childhood; assessment of developmental progress at each visit; evaluation by a craniofacial team regularly in infancy, childhood, and adolescence; dental care every six months; assessment for velopharyngeal insufficiency after emergence of language; assessment for speech disorders, ophthalmologic evaluation, and audiologic/otologic assessments at least annually; evaluation for the development of scoliosis annually in childhood and adolescence. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Contact sports and activities that involve neck hyperflexion or extension for those with cervical spine anomalies; factors that potentiate hearing loss; use of CPAP/BiPAP for long-term treatment of sleep apnea. Pregnancy management: For affected pregnant women: monitoring for signs and symptoms of worsening obstructive sleep apnea and anethesia evaluation prior to initiation of labor to identify any multilevel airway anomalies or vertebral anomalies that would result in additional risk with certain types of anesthesia; fiberoptic intubation could be required. Genetic counseling Apert syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. However, most individuals with Apert syndrome have the disorder as the result of a de novo FGFR2 pathogenic variant. Advanced paternal age has been shown to be associated with de novo pathogenic variants for Apert syndrome. Affected individuals have a 50% chance of passing the pathogenic variant to each child. Prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk is possible if the pathogenic variant has been identified in the family."

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Individuals with biallelic APOB-related familial hypobetalipoproteinemia (APOB-FHBL) may present from infancy through to adulthood with a range of clinical symptoms including deficiency of fat-soluble vitamins and gastrointestinal and neurologic dysfunction. Affected individuals typically have plasma total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and apo B levels below the fifth centile for age and sex. Acanthocytosis, elevated liver enzymes, and hyperbilirubinemia may also be found. The most common clinical findings are hepatomegaly, steatorrhea, and failure to thrive / growth deficiency. In the absence of treatment, affected individuals can develop atypical pigmentation of the retina; progressive loss of deep tendon reflexes, vibratory sense, and proprioception; muscle pain or weakness; dysarthria; ataxia; tremors; and steatohepatitis, fibrosis, and rarely, cirrhosis of the liver. Individuals with a heterozygous, typically truncating pathogenic variant in APOB are usually asymptomatic with mild liver dysfunction and hepatic steatosis. However, about 5%-10% of individuals with heterozygous APOB- FHBL develop relatively more severe nonalcoholic steatohepatitis requiring medical attention and occasionally progressing to cirrhosis, albeit very rarely. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of biallelic APOB-related familial hypobetalipoproteinemia (APOB-FHBL) or heterozygous APOB-FHBL is established in a proband with either biallelic or a heterozygous pathogenic variant(s), respectively, in APOB identified by molecular genetic testing Management Treatment of manifestations: Author Affiliations: 1 Department of Clinical Biochemistry Royal Perth Hospital & Fiona Stanley Hospital Network PathWest Laboratory Medicine WA; Faculty of Health & Medical Sciences School of Medicine University of Western Australia Perth, Australia; Email: john.burnett@health.wa.gov.au; Email: amanda.hooper@health.wa.gov.au. 2 Departments of Medicine and Biochemistry Schulich School of Medicine and Robarts Research Institute Western University London, Ontario, Canada; Email: hegele@robarts.ca.

GeneReviews Individuals with biallelic APOB-FHBL: low-fat diet (<30% of total calories) while ensuring adequate caloric intake; high-dose oral fat-soluble vitamin supplementation (vitamin E: 100-300 IU/kg/day; vitamin A: 100-400 IU/kg/day; vitamin D: 800-1200 IU/day; vitamin K: 5-35 mg/week); consideration of oral essential fatty acid supplementation; liver transplantation may be considered for those with end-stage liver disease; standard treatment for ataxia, dysarthria, and loss of night and/or color vision and scotomas; no treatment is typically required for anemia/hemolysis. Individuals with heterozygous APOB-FHBL: no treatment typically required. Prevention of primary manifestations: Adoption of a low-fat diet (<30% of total calories) and high-dose oral fat- soluble vitamin supplementation may ameliorate or prevent clinical features of APOB-FHBL. Surveillance: Individuals with biallelic APOB-FHBL: measurement of growth parameters and assessment for new or progressive signs/symptoms of gastrointestinal issues every 6-12 months; laboratory studies to include lipid profile, liver function tests, vitamin levels, INR, calcium, phosphorus, uric acid, CBC, vitamin B12, folate and TSH every 1-2 years; ophthalmology evaluation and neurologic examination every 6-12 months after age 10 years; hepatic ultrasound and bone mineral densitometry studies every 3-5 years after age 10 years. Individuals with heterozygous APOB-FHBL: laboratory studies to include lipid profile and liver function tests every 1-2 years; hepatic ultrasound every 3 years after age 10 years in those with elevated liver transaminases. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Individuals with biallelic APOB-FHBL should avoid fatty foods. No dietary restrictions are typically required for those with heterozygous APOB-FHBL. Evaluation of relatives at risk: It is appropriate to clarify the genetic status of apparently asymptomatic older and younger at-risk relatives of an individual with biallelic APOB-FHBL in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from prompt initiation of treatment and preventive measures. Evaluations can include a full lipid profile (including apo B concentration) and/or molecular genetic testing for the APOB pathogenic variant(s) identified in the proband. Pregnancy management: Vitamin A excess can be harmful to the developing fetus. Therefore, women who are pregnant or are planning to become pregnant should reduce their vitamin A supplement dose by 50%. Additionally, close monitoring of serum vitamin A levels throughout pregnancy is recommended. Because vitamin A is an essential vitamin, however, vitamin A supplementation for affected women should not be discontinued during pregnancy. Genetic counseling APOB-related familial hypobetalipoproteinemia (APOB-FHBL) caused by homozygous (or compound heterozygous) pathogenic variants in APOB is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. At conception, each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being heterozygous for APOB- FHBL and having laboratory findings and (rarely) clinical features, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a heterozygote.

Clinical characteristics APOE p.Leu167del is a rare genetic variant described in 38 cases in the literature with a range of clinical phenotypes. Three phenotypes can be associated with the APOE p.Leu167del variant: Inherited lipemic splenomegaly (also known as sea-blue histiocytosis) characterized by hypertriglyceridemia and splenomegaly. Variable manifestations include thrombocytopenia, liver function abnormalities, and cardiovascular disease Autosomal dominant hypercholesterolemia (ADH) characterized by markedly elevated LDL cholesterol levels that leads to premature morbidity and mortality from atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) Familial combined hyperlipidemia (FCHL) characterized by variable elevations of total cholesterol, triglycerides, or LDL cholesterol and a high risk of premature ASCVD It has been suggested that the phenotype associated with the APOE p.Leu167del variant may depend on multiple factors, including sex, APOE genotype, control of hyperlipidemia, gene-gene interactions, gene-environment interactions, or perhaps epigenetic and other non-mendelian effects. Diagnosis/testing Diagnosis relies on detection of a heterozygous APOE p.Leu167del pathogenic variant. Determining whether the second APOE allele is the benign variant e2 or the benign variant e3 may be of some clinical predictive value.

Copyright 1993-2024, University of Washington, Seattle. GeneReviews is a registered trademark of the University of Washington, Seattle. All rights reserved. Management GeneReviews Treatment of manifestations: No formal management guidelines exist. Individuals with hyperlipidemia should be treated according to their overall cardiovascular risk profile. Treatment for individuals with documented ASCVD or at high risk of developing ASCVD begins with lifestyle changes (adherence to a heart-healthy diet, exercise, tobacco avoidance, maintenance of a healthy weight) and may also include statin, fibrate, high-dose fish oil, and/or niacin therapy. Although no interventions are known to prevent disease progression, it has been suggested that treatment of dyslipidemia may prevent development of splenomegaly. Splenectomy should be avoided as it may worsen hyperlipidemia. Liver function abnormalities and thrombocytopenia are managed in a routine manner. Diabetes mellitus (if present) should be well controlled. Surveillance: No formal surveillance guidelines exist. The authors suggest the following: Lipoprotein profile one year after diagnosis and every 2-5 years thereafter (if normal). If abnormal, follow at regular intervals for treatment of hyperlipidemia. Liver function panel, albumin, INR (prothrombin time) one year after diagnosis and every 2-5 years thereafter (if normal) Platelet count one year after diagnosis and every 2-5 years thereafter (if normal) Agents/circumstances to avoid: Splenectomy, which may worsen the hypertriglyceridemia. For those with splenomegaly: contact sports given the increased risk for splenic rupture. Evaluation of relatives at risk: Clarifying the genetic status of relatives at risk of inheriting the APOE p.Leu167del variant allows early adoption of preventive measures and surveillance. Pregnancy management: In a woman with the APOE p.Leu167del variant, triglyceride levels should be measured when pregnancy is identified and at least one to two times later in pregnancy as severe hypertriglyceridemia (>500 mg/dL) in pregnancy increases the risk for pancreatitis and fetal and maternal death. Before taking a medication during pregnancy, a pregnant woman should discuss with her physician the risks and benefits of that medication. Genetic counseling The APOE p.Leu167del variant is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. The proportion of APOE p.Leu167del-related lipid disorders caused by de novo mutation is unknown. The phenotype associated with the APOE p.Leu167del variant appears to depend on multiple factors. Each child of an affected individual has a 50% chance of inheriting the variant. Prenatal testing for at-risk pregnancies is possible; however, requests for prenatal testing for conditions such as APOE p.Leu167del-related lipid disorders are not common."

Kidney stones, the most common clinical manifestation of APRT deficiency, can occur at any age; in at least 50% of affected persons symptoms do not occur until adulthood. If adequate treatment is not provided, approximately 20%-25% of affected individuals develop end-stage renal disease (ESRD), usually in adult life. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of APRT deficiency is established in a proband by absence of APRT enzyme activity in red cell lysates or identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in APRT. The detection of the characteristic round, brown DHA crystals by urine microscopy is highly suggestive of the disorder. Management Treatment of manifestations: Treatment with the xanthine oxidoreductase inhibitors (XOR; xanthine dehydrogenase/oxidase) allopurinol or febuxostat can improve kidney function, even in individuals with advanced CKD. The prescribed dose of allopurinol and febuxostat should not routinely be reduced in affected individuals who have impaired kidney function. Ample fluid intake is advised. Surgical management of DHA nephrolithiasis is the same as for other types of kidney stones. ESRD is treated with dialysis and kidney transplantation.

Most commonly, birth and early childhood are normal. Untreated individuals have slowing of linear growth at age one to three years, followed by development of spasticity, plateauing of cognitive development, and subsequent loss of developmental milestones. If untreated, arginase deficiency usually progresses to severe spasticity, loss of ambulation, complete loss of bowel and bladder control, and severe intellectual disability. Seizures are common and are usually controlled easily. Individuals treated from birth, either as a result of newborn screening or having an affected older sib, appear to have minimal symptoms. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of arginase deficiency is established in a proband with suggestive clinical and/or biochemical findings and confirmed by identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in ARG1 or, in limited instances, by failure to detect arginase enzyme activity (usually <1% of normal) in red blood cell extracts. Management Treatment of manifestations: Management should closely mirror that for urea cycle disorders, except that individuals with arginase deficiency are not as likely to have episodes of hyperammonemia; if present, such episodes respond to conservative management (e.g., intravenous fluid administration). Treatment should involve a team coordinated by a metabolic specialist. Routine outpatient management includes restriction of dietary protein and consideration of oral nitrogen-scavenging drugs (in those who have chronic or recurrent hyperammonemia).

Assessment of metabolic control (plasma ammonia, amino acid profile, and nutritional labs) at least monthly for the first year of life and as determined by a metabolic specialist after the first year of life; guanidinoacetate and liver function tests every six to 12 months; monitoring of growth and developmental progress at each visit. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Valproic acid (exacerbates hyperammonemia). Evaluation of relatives at risk: Plasma quantitative amino acid analysis, molecular genetic testing (if the family- specific pathogenic variants are known), or enzymatic testing in all sibs (especially younger ones) of a proband to allow early diagnosis and treatment of those found to be affected. Pregnancy management: In general, affected pregnant women should continue dietary protein restriction and ammonia-scavenging medications (after an appropriate benefit/risk calculation) based on their clinical course before pregnancy. Other: Immunizations on the usual schedule; appropriate use of antipyretics as indicated (ibuprofen preferred over acetaminophen). Genetic counseling Arginase deficiency is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. At conception, each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Heterozygotes (carriers) are asymptomatic. Carrier testing for at-risk relatives and prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk are possible if the ARG1 pathogenic variants in the family are known."

Absence of treatment leads to worsening lethargy, seizures, coma, and even death. In contrast, the manifestations of late-onset form range from episodic hyperammonemia triggered by acute infection or stress to cognitive impairment, behavioral abnormalities, and/or learning disabilities in the absence of any documented episodes of hyperammonemia. Manifestations of ASL deficiency that appear to be unrelated to the severity or duration of hyperammonemic episodes: Neurocognitive deficiencies (attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, developmental delay, seizures, and learning disability) Liver disease (hepatitis, cirrhosis) Trichorrhexis nodosa (coarse brittle hair that breaks easily) Systemic hypertension Diagnosis/testing Elevated plasma ammonia concentration (>100 mol/L), elevated plasma citrulline concentration (usually 100-300 mol/L), and elevated argininosuccinic acid in the plasma or urine establish the diagnosis of ASL deficiency.

Note: All 50 states in the US include ASL deficiency in their newborn screening programs. Management Treatment of manifestations: Treatment involves rapid control of hyperammonemia during metabolic decompensations and long-term management to help prevent episodes of hyperammonemia and long-term complications. During acute hyperammonemic episodes, oral protein intake is discontinued, oral intake is supplemented with intravenous lipids and/or glucose, and intravenous nitrogen-scavenging therapy is used. If ammonia levels do not normalize, hemodialysis is the next step. Dietary restriction of protein and dietary supplementation with arginine are the mainstays in long-term management; for those not responsive to these measures, oral nitrogen-scavenging therapy can be considered. Orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) is considered only in patients with recurrent hyperammonemia or metabolic decompensations resistant to conventional medical therapy. Surveillance: Monitoring the concentration of plasma amino acids to identify deficiency of essential amino acids and impending hyperammonemia at intervals depending on age and metabolic status. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Excess protein intake; less than recommended intake of protein; prolonged fasting or starvation; obvious exposure to communicable diseases; valproic acid; intravenous steroids; hepatotoxic drugs (in those with hepatic involvement).

Disease onset of classic ARSACS is often in early childhood, leading to delayed walking because of gait unsteadiness in very young toddlers, while an increasing number of individuals with disease onset in teenage or early-adult years are now being described. Typically the ataxia is followed by lower-limb spasticity and later by peripheral neuropathy although pronounced peripheral neuropathy has been observed as a first sign of ARSACS. Oculomotor disturbances, dysarthria, and upper-limb ataxia develop with slower progression than the other findings. Brain imaging demonstrates atrophy of the superior vermis and the cerebellar hemisphere with additional findings on MRI, such as linear hypointensities in the pons and hyperintense rims around the thalami. Many affected individuals (though not all) have yellow streaks of hypermyelinated fibers radiating from the edges of the optic disc noted on ophthalmologic exam, and thickened retinal fibers can be demonstrated by optical coherence tomography. Mild intellectual disability, hearing loss, and urinary urgency and incontinence have been reported in some individuals. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of ARSACS is established in a proband with suggestive clinical findings and biallelic pathogenic variants in SACS identified on molecular genetic testing.

Skeletal findings include pectus excavatum or carinatum, arachnodactyly, scoliosis, knee/elbow contractures, and camptodactyly. The cardiovascular system is the major source of morbidity and mortality with increased risk at any age for aneurysm formation and dissection both at the aortic root and throughout the arterial tree, and for ischemic vascular events involving cerebrovascular circulation (resulting in non-hemorrhagic stroke) and the abdominal arteries (resulting in infarctions of abdominal organs). Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of ATS is established in a proband with generalized arterial tortuosity and biallelic (homozygous or compound heterozygous) pathogenic variants in SLC2A10 identified on molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Individuals with ATS benefit from a coordinated approach of multidisciplinary specialists in a medical center familiar with ATS. Although hemodynamic stress on arterial walls can be reduced with use of beta-adrenergic blockers or other medications including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) and angiotensin II receptor 1 (ATIIR1) antagonists such as losartan, the efficacy of these treatments has not been established in ATS and caution is warranted when using blood pressure-lowering medications in the presence of arterial stenosis (anatomic or functional due to severe tortuosity), especially renal artery stenosis. Aneurysms and focal stenoses are amenable to surgical intervention. Wound healing may be delayed following surgery; thus, stitches should be placed without traction and remain in place approximately ten days.

Classic FD is characterized by onset in the first weeks of life of painful, progressive deformity of the major joints; palpable subcutaneous nodules of joints and mechanical pressure points; and a hoarse cry resulting from granulomas of the larynx and epiglottis. Life expectancy is usually less than two years. In the other less common types of FD, onset, severity, and primary manifestations vary. SMA-PME is characterized by early-childhood-onset progressive lower motor neuron disease manifest typically between ages three and seven years as proximal lower-extremity weakness, followed by progressive myoclonic and atonic seizures, tremulousness/tremor, and sensorineural hearing loss. Myoclonic epilepsy typically begins in late childhood after the onset of weakness and can include jerking of the upper limbs, action myoclonus, myoclonic status, and eyelid myoclonus. Other findings include generalized tremor, and cognitive decline. The time from disease onset to death from respiratory complications is usually five to 15 years.

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics The phenotypic spectrum of ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T), a multisystem disorder, is a continuum ranging from classic A-T at the severe end and variant A-T at the milder end. Nonetheless, distinguishing between classic A-T and variant A-T on this spectrum helps understand differences in disease course, rate of progression, and life expectancy. Classic A-T is characterized by childhood onset of progressive neurologic manifestations (initially cerebellar ataxia, followed typically by extrapyramidal involvement and peripheral sensorimotor neuropathy), immunodeficiency (variably associated with abnormalities of humoral immunity, cellular immunity, or combined immune deficiency), pulmonary disease (resulting from recurrent infections, immune deficiency, aspiration, interstitial lung disease, and neurologic abnormalities), and increased risk of malignancy. Although it is generally accepted that intellectual disability is not common in A-T, disturbances in cerebellar as well as non- cerebellar brain areas and networks may result in cognitive deficits. Increased sensitivity to ionizing radiation (x- ray and gamma ray) can result in severe side effects from such treatments. Life expectancy is significantly reduced due to cancer, pulmonary disease, and infections. Variant A-T has a significantly milder disease course. While cerebellar ataxia can be absent, extrapyramidal movement disorders are common (typically dystonia and dystonic tremor) and most individuals have manifestations of axonal sensorimotor polyneuropathy. In contrast to classic A-T, immune function is generally normal, respiratory infections are not increased, and pulmonary disease is not a major feature. However, risk of developing malignancies is increased, particularly in premenopausal females who have an increased risk of developing breast cancer and hematologic malignancies.

Diagnosis/testing GeneReviews The diagnosis of A-T is established in a proband with suggestive findings and biallelic pathogenic variants in ATM identified by molecular genetic testing. Of note, newborn screening (NBS) for severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) that relies on the identification of reduced T-cell receptor excision circle (TREC) levels in blood spots most likely identifies about 50% of children with classic A-T, who require immediate subspecialty evaluation at a center with expertise in the diagnosis of SCID, its causes, and its treatment. Management Treatment of manifestations: Supportive care to improve quality of life, maximize function, and reduce complications ideally involves multidisciplinary care by specialists in (pediatric) neurology, pulmonology, immunology, pediatrics (for children) and internal medicine (for adults), rehabilitation medicine, and professionals in physical therapy, speech-language therapy, occupational therapy, and nutrition. For specific issues care may be provided by specialists in oncology, medical genetics, endocrinology, orthopedics, dermatology, mental health, and social work. Surveillance: Routine evaluations by treating clinicians is necessary to monitor existing manifestations, the individual's response to supportive care, and the emergence of new manifestations. Recommended surveillance is the same for individuals with classic A-T and variant A-T, with the exception that individuals who do not have evidence of lung disease at the time of initial diagnosis do not require annual screening for pulmonary disease. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Rubella vaccination should be avoided in individuals with severe immunodeficiency as it can possibly increase the risk for granulomas; ionizing radiation (x-ray and gamma ray) is contraindicated, due to increased sensitivity; and radiation therapy is contraindicated because increased radiosensitivity may lead to very severe complications. Evaluation of relatives at risk: It is appropriate to offer molecular genetic testing for the familial ATM pathogenic variants to apparently asymptomatic older and younger at-risk relatives of an affected individual in order to identify as early as possible sibs with biallelic ATM pathogenic variants who would benefit from prompt initiation of treatment of manifestations of A-T, surveillance for malignancy, and awareness of agents/ circumstances to avoid; and family members who are heterozygous for an ATM pathogenic variant and who would benefit from age-appropriate intensified surveillance for breast cancer. Therapies under investigation: Use of intra-erythrocyte dexamethasone; the effects of nicotinamide riboside (a form of vitamin B3) on ataxia scores and immunoglobulin levels; gene therapy with antisense oligonucleotides in a single case study; effect of allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation on neurologic functioning. Genetic counseling A-T is caused by biallelic pathogenic variants in ATM and inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. If both parents are known to be heterozygous for an ATM pathogenic variant, each sib of an affected individual has at conception a 25% chance of inheriting biallelic pathogenic variants and having A-T, a 50% chance of inheriting one pathogenic variant and being heterozygous, and a 25% chance of inheriting neither of the familial ATM pathogenic variants. Although individuals heterozygous for an ATM pathogenic variant are not at risk for A-T, their risk of developing cancer is increased compared to that of the general population (in particular, heterozygous females have an increased risk of developing breast cancer). Once the ATM pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member, heterozygote testing for at-risk relatives and prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing for A-T are possible. 3"

This can include multidisciplinary care by specialists in clinical genetics, neurology, ophthalmology, gastroenterology, cardiology, and general pediatrics. Surveillance: Regular clinic visits are recommended due to the complexity of the medical and developmental issues. The frequency of visits should be decided on a person-by-person basis, but may need to be greater (e.g., Author Affiliations: 1 Faculty of Medicine and Health, University of New South Wales, Randwick, New South Wales, Australia; Email: whittonchloe@gmail.com; chloe.whitton@health.nsw.gov.au. 2 Discipline of Pdiatrics and Child Health, Faculty of Medicine and Health, University of New South Wales, Randwick, New South Wales, Australia; Email: elizabeth.palmer@unsw.edu.au. 3 Sydney Children's Hospitals Network, New South Wales, Australia; Email: elizabeth.palmer@unsw.edu.au. 4 Department of Translational Genomics, Center for Genomic Medicine, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; Email: falkuraya@kfshrc.edu.sa.

Agents/circumstances to avoid: In individuals with MRI-confirmed stenosis of the craniocervical junction, caution is required when manipulating the head and neck for airway management. Genetic counseling ATN1-NDD is an autosomal dominant condition typically caused by a de novo pathogenic variant. Risk to future pregnancies is presumed to be low as the proband most likely has a de novo ATN1 pathogenic variant. There is, however, a recurrence risk (~1%) to sibs based on the theoretic possibility of parental germline mosaicism. Given this risk, prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing may be considered."

The first manifestations include progressive ataxia, clumsiness of the hands, loss of proprioception, and areflexia. Other features often observed are dysdiadochokinesia, dysarthria, positive Romberg sign, head titubation, decreased visual acuity, and positive Babinski sign. Although age of onset and disease course are more uniform within a given family, disease manifestations and their severity can vary even among sibs. When lifelong high-dose vitamin E supplementation is initiated in presymptomatic individuals, manifestations of AVED do not develop. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of AVED is established in a proband with suggestive findings and biallelic pathogenic variants in TTPA identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Targeted therapy: Lifelong targeted therapy with high-dose oral vitamin E supplementation (that brings plasma vitamin E concentrations into the high-normal range) initiated in presymptomatic individuals (e.g., younger sibs of an index case) prevents the manifestations of AVED. Vitamin E supplementation early in the disease course of a symptomatic individual may to some extent reverse ataxia and mental deterioration. Supportive care: Supportive care for those with ataxia and related findings is the same multidisciplinary care for individuals with ataxia of other causes. Surveillance: Monitor plasma vitamin E concentration in treated individuals particularly children every six months.

The facial features are often described as \\\"Down syndrome-like\\\" and include brachycephaly, flat facial appearance, short nose, long philtrum, narrow mouth, and low-set and posteriorly rotated ears. Hearing loss is often congenital. Other features may include postnatal short stature, seizure disorder, nonspecific brain abnormalities on head imaging, skeletal abnormalities, and joint limitations. A subset of individuals have been found to have pericarditis or pericardial effusion during the neonatal or infantile period. All affected individuals have had developmental delay, but the degree of cognitive impairment is extremely variable.

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Beta-thalassemia (-thalassemia) has two clinically significant forms, -thalassemia major and -thalassemia intermedia, caused by absent or reduced synthesis of the hemoglobin subunit beta (beta globin chain). Individuals with -thalassemia major present between ages six and 24 months with pallor due to severe anemia, poor weight gain, stunted growth, mild jaundice, and hepatosplenomegaly. Feeding problems, diarrhea, irritability, and recurrent bouts of fever may occur. Treatment with regular red blood cell transfusions and iron chelation therapy allows for normal growth and development and improves prognosis. Long-term complications associated with iron overload include stunted growth, dilated cardiomyopathy, liver disease, and endocrinopathies. Individuals with -thalassemia intermedia have a more variable age of presentation due to milder anemia that does not require regular red blood cell transfusions from early childhood. Additional clinical features may include jaundice, cholelithiasis, hepatosplenomegaly, skeletal changes (long bone deformities, characteristic craniofacial features, and osteoporosis), leg ulcers, pulmonary hypertension, extramedullary masses of hyperplastic erythroid marrow, and increased risk of thrombotic complications. Individuals with -thalassemia intermedia are at risk for iron overload secondary to increased intestinal absorption of iron as a result of dysregulation of iron metabolism caused by ineffective erythropoiesis. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of -thalassemia is established in a proband older than age 12 months by identification of microcytic hypochromic anemia, absence of iron deficiency, anisopoikilocytosis with nucleated red blood cells on peripheral blood smear, and decreased or complete absence of hemoglobin A (HbA) and increased hemoglobin A2 (HbA2) and often hemoglobin F (HbF) on hemoglobin analysis. Identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in HBB on molecular genetic testing can establish the diagnosis in individuals younger than age 12 months who have a positive or suggestive newborn screening result and/or unexplained microcytic hypochromic anemia with anisopoikilocytosis and nucleated red blood cells on peripheral blood smear.

Management GeneReviews Targeted therapies: For -thalassemia major, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), cord blood transplantation from a related donor, or autologous HSCT with gene therapy. Supportive care: For -thalassemia major, regular red blood cell transfusions with iron chelation therapy (e.g., deferoxamine B, deferiprone, deferasirox). Transfusion requirements may be reduced with the use of luspatercept. Anticoagulation for unprovoked venous thromboembolism; cholecystectomy for biliary colic; additional treatments for osteoporosis include hormone replacement therapy, vitamin D supplementation, regular physical activity, and bisphosphonates. For -thalassemia intermedia, splenectomy, folic acid supplementation, red blood cell transfusions as needed, and iron chelation. Some individuals can benefit from HbF induction with hydroxyurea. Luspatercept may also be used to ameliorate anemia with variable efficacy. Cholecystectomy for biliary colic; vitamin D supplementation, regular physical activity, and bisphosphonates for osteoporosis; referral for treatment of pulmonary hypertension; anticoagulation for unprovoked venous thromboembolism. Surveillance: For -thalassemia major, complete blood count every three to four weeks and with illnesses. For - thalassemia intermedia, complete blood count every three to four months and with illnesses. Additional surveillance in individuals with -thalassemia major and -thalassemia intermedia: monitor efficacy and side effects of transfusion therapy and chelation therapy with monthly physical examination; evaluation of growth and development every three months during childhood; ALT and serum ferritin every three months; annual evaluation of eyes, hearing, heart, endocrine function (thyroid, endocrine pancreas, parathyroid, adrenal, pituitary), and myocardial and liver MRI. In adults: bone densitometry to assess for osteoporosis; serum alpha- fetoprotein concentration for early detection of hepatocarcinoma in those with hepatitis C and iron overload. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Alcohol consumption if there is history of liver damage, iron-containing preparations, and exposure to infection. Evaluation of relatives at risk: If the pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member, molecular genetic testing of at-risk sibs should be offered to allow for early diagnosis and treatment. Hematologic testing can be used if the pathogenic variants in the family are not known. Pregnancy management: Individuals with -thalassemia major often require increased red blood cell transfusions during pregnancy. Individuals with -thalassemia intermedia often have a significant drop in hemoglobin necessitating regular red blood cell transfusions during pregnancy, and those who have never received a red blood cell transfusion or who received minimal transfusions are at risk for severe alloimmune anemia if red blood cell transfusions are required during pregnancy. Iron chelation should not be given during fetal organogenesis and may be started in the second trimester if necessary due to extent of maternal iron overload. Cardiac evaluation including pulmonary hypertension screening is recommended prior to conception. Genetic counseling Beta-thalassemia major and -thalassemia intermedia are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. If both parents are known to be heterozygous for an HBB pathogenic variant, each sib of an affected individual has at conception a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being a (typically) asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. If one parent is known to be heterozygous for an HBB pathogenic variant and the other parent is affected with -thalassemia, each sib of an affected individual has a 50% chance of inheriting biallelic HBB pathogenic variants and being affected and a 50% chance of inheriting one HBB pathogenic variant and being a (typically) asymptomatic carrier. Carrier testing for at-risk relatives can be done by hematologic and/or molecular genetic testing (if the familial pathogenic variants are known).

Hepatocellular carcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma, and meningioma may also be associated with BAP1-TPDS. Affected individuals can have more than one type of primary cancer. In general, the median age of onset of these tumors is younger than in the general population.

Many individuals have a recognizable appearance with macrocephaly, frontal bossing, coarse facial features, and facial milia. Most individuals have skeletal anomalies (e.g., bifid ribs, wedge-shaped vertebrae). Ectopic calcification, particularly in the falx, is present in 90% of affected individuals by age 30 years. Cardiac and ovarian fibromas occur in approximately 2% and 20% of individuals, respectively. Approximately 5% of all children with NBCCS develop medulloblastoma (primitive neuroectodermal tumor), generally the desmoplastic subtype. The risk of developing medulloblastoma is substantially higher in individuals with an SUFU pathogenic variant (33%) than in those with a PTCH1 pathogenic variant (<2%). Peak incidence is at age one to two years. Life expectancy in NBCCS is not significantly different from average. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of NBCCS is established in a proband who fulfills proposed diagnostic clinical criteria. Identification of a heterozygous germline pathogenic variant in PTCH1 or SUFU by molecular genetic testing establishes the diagnosis if clinical features are inconclusive. Management Treatment of manifestations: Best provided by specialists experienced with the condition; avoidance of direct sun exposure through the use of complete sunblock and covering of exposed skin with long sleeves, high collars, and hats; early treatment of BCCs to ensure complete eradication of aggressive BCCs and to preserve normal tissue to prevent disfigurement; sonic hedgehog inhibitors such as vismodegib to treat severe BCCs; jaw keratocysts usually require surgical excision; treatment of medulloblastoma per neurosurgeon/oncologist.

Clinical features typically include intellectual disability / developmental delay ranging from mild to severe affecting both motor and language skills. Most affected individuals are verbal and ambulatory, with most walking by age 15-36 months. Hypotonia in infancy and childhood can exacerbate motor and expressive speech delay and, in some cases, cause feeding difficulties that require nasogastric or gastrostomy tube feeding. Some affected individuals display movement disorders. About one third of affected individuals have epilepsy. Other neurobehavioral features can include autism, anxiety, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Strabismus and refractive errors are found in about half of affected individuals. Both conductive and sensorineural hearing loss have been observed. Approximately half of individuals exhibit typical growth and half exhibit growth abnormalities, with overgrowth being more common than undergrowth and macrocephaly being the most common manifestation of altered growth. While many affected individuals have dysmorphic features, these are typically nonspecific. Congenital heart defects, brain malformations, and genitourinary anomalies are less common findings. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of TET3-BEFAHRS is established in a proband with suggestive findings and a heterozygous pathogenic variant in TET3 identified by molecular genetic testing. DNA methylation profiling can help confirm variant pathogenicity. Management Treatment of manifestations: Standardized treatment with anti-seizure medication (ASM) by an experienced neurologist; feeding therapy; gastrostomy tube placement may be required for persistent feeding issues; pressure- equalizing tubes for conductive hearing loss; hearing aids for sensorineural hearing loss; standard treatment for Author Affiliation: 1 Department of Genetic Medicine, Department of Pediatrics, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland; Email: jfahrne1@jhmi.edu.

GeneReviews constipation, musculoskeletal issues, refractive error, strabismus, nystagmus, behavioral issues, developmental delay / intellectual disability, congenital heart defects, and genitourinary anomalies. Surveillance: At each visit: measurement of growth parameters; evaluation of nutritional status and safety of oral intake; assessment for new manifestations, such as seizures and changes in tone; monitoring of developmental progress and educational needs; behavioral assessment; assessment for signs and symptoms of constipation; assessment of mobility and self-help skills; clinical evaluation for kyphosis and/or scoliosis. At least annually: complete ophthalmology evaluation and audiology evaluation. Pregnancy management: Exposure to ASMs may increase the risk for adverse fetal outcome (depending on the drug used, the dose, and the stage of pregnancy at which medication is taken). Nevertheless, the risk of an adverse outcome to the fetus from ASM exposure is often less than that associated with exposure to an untreated maternal seizure disorder. Therefore, use of ASMs to treat a maternal seizure disorder during pregnancy is typically recommended. Discussion of the risks and benefits of using a given ASM during pregnancy should ideally take place prior to conception. Transitioning to a lower-risk medication prior to pregnancy may be possible. Genetic counseling TET3-BEFAHRS is an autosomal dominant disorder. Most probands have a de novo pathogenic variant, though inherited variants have been reported. Rarely, affected individuals can have biallelic pathogenic variants inherited in trans from heterozygous parents who have milder features of TET3-BEFAHRS. This is now thought to represent autosomal dominant inheritance with variable expressivity as opposed to autosomal recessive inheritance. The risk to the sibs of the proband depends on the genetic status of the proband's parents. If one parent of the proband has a TET3 pathogenic variant, the risk to the sibs of inheriting the pathogenic variant and being affected is 50%. If both parents of a proband have a TET3 pathogenic variant, sibs have a 75% chance of inheriting one or two pathogenic variants and being affected and a 25% chance of inheriting neither pathogenic variant and not being affected. Once the TET3 pathogenic variant(s) have been identified in an affected family member, prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing are possible."

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Collagen VI-related dystrophies (COL6-RDs) represent a continuum of overlapping clinical phenotypes with Bethlem muscular dystrophy at the milder end, Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy (UCMD) at the more severe end, and a phenotype in between UCMD and Bethlem muscular dystrophy, referred to as intermediate COL6-RD. Bethlem muscular dystrophy is characterized by a combination of proximal muscle weakness and joint contractures. Hypotonia and delayed motor milestones occur in early childhood; mild hypotonia and weakness may be present congenitally. By adulthood, there is evidence of proximal weakness and contractures of the elbows, Achilles tendons, and long finger flexors. The progression of weakness is slow, and more than two thirds of affected individuals older than age 50 years remain independently ambulatory indoors, while relying on supportive means for mobility outdoors. Respiratory involvement is not a consistent feature. UCMD is characterized by congenital weakness, hypotonia, proximal joint contractures, and striking hyperlaxity of distal joints. Decreased fetal movements are frequently reported. Some affected children acquire the ability to walk independently; however, progression of the disease results in a loss of ambulation by age ten to eleven years. Early and severe respiratory insufficiency occurs in all individuals, resulting in the need for nocturnal noninvasive ventilation (NIV) in the form of bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) by age 11 years. Intermediate COL6-RD is characterized by independent ambulation past age 11 years and respiratory insufficiency that is later in onset than in UCMD and results in the need for NIV in the form of BiPAP by the late teens to early 20s. In contrast to individuals with Bethlem muscular dystrophy, those with intermediate COL6-RD typically do not achieve the ability to run, jump, or climb stairs without use of a railing.

Diagnosis/testing GeneReviews The diagnosis of a COL6-RD can be suspected in a proband with characteristic clinical features, muscle imaging features, and muscle immunohistochemical features. The diagnosis can be confirmed by identification of a heterozygous or biallelic pathogenic variant(s) in COL6A1, COL6A2, or COL6A3. Management Treatment of manifestations Bethlem muscular dystrophy. BiPAP as needed to support nocturnal ventilation and prevent right heart strain; scoliosis treatment per orthopedics; if surgical treatment for scoliosis is needed, coordinate with orthopedics, anesthesia, intensive care, and pulmonary specialists; physical therapy and occupational therapy to provide recommendations for joint stretching, swimming, and aquatherapy; treatment of Achilles tendon contractures per orthopedist. UCMD / intermediate COL6-RD. BiPAP to support ventilation and prevent right heart strain. Use of insufflator/exsufflator to promote airway clearance; treatment of scoliosis per orthopedist; if surgical treatment for scoliosis is needed, coordinate with orthopedics, anesthesia, intensive care, and pulmonary specialists; physical therapy and occupational therapy to provide recommendations for joint stretching, swimming, and aquatherapy; treatment of Achilles tendon contractures per orthopedist; feeding and nutrition support as needed for failure to thrive. Surveillance Bethlem muscular dystrophy. Respiratory surveillance including annual pulmonary function tests (PFTs) in the upright and supine positions and polysomnogram for assessing for nocturnal hypoventilation with BiPAP initiation and follow-up polysomnograms as needed; annual clinical and radiographic assessment of scoliosis; annual cardiac evaluation with echocardiogram and EKG; annual physical therapy and occupational therapy assessment of muscle weakness, joint contractures, and need for mobility devices. UCMD / intermediate COL6-RD. Respiratory surveillance including PFTs in the upright and supine positions every six months and polysomnogram to assess for nocturnal hypoventilation for timely initiation of NIV in the form of BiPAP with follow-up polysomnograms every one to two years; annual clinical and radiographic assessment of scoliosis; annual cardiac evaluation with echocardiogram and EKG; physical therapy and occupational therapy assessments of muscle weakness, joint contractures, and need for mobility devices every six months; nutritional assessments every six months. Because respiratory insufficiency is a leading cause of failure to thrive, assessments of ventilation (with PFTs and polysomnogram) are essential as surveillance both for respiratory insufficiency and for failure to thrive. Genetic counseling The COL6-RDs can be inherited in an autosomal dominant or an autosomal recessive manner. Bethlem muscular dystrophy is usually inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, although autosomal recessive inheritance has also been reported. UCMD and intermediate COL6-RD are typically caused by a de novo autosomal dominant COL6A1, COL6A2, or COL6A3 pathogenic variant. Less commonly, UCMD and intermediate COL6-RD are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Parental somatic mosaicism (and concomitant germline mosaicism) is not uncommon in the autosomal dominant COL6-RDs. Autosomal dominant. If a parent of the proband has the pathogenic variant identified in the proband and/or is affected, the risk to the sibs of inheriting the variant is 50%. The severity of COL6-RD manifestations may vary among family members who are heterozygous for the same pathogenic variant. Autosomal recessive. If both parents are known to be heterozygous for a pathogenic variant, each sib of an affected individual has at conception a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an VI-Related Dystrophies 3 asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Carrier testing for at-risk relatives requires prior identification of the COL6A1, COL6A2, or COL6A3 pathogenic variants in the family. Once the COL6A1, COL6A2, or COL6A3 pathogenic variant(s) have been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible."

Additional, less common phenotypes consisting of neonatal encephalopathy with non-epileptic myoclonus, infantile or childhood-onset developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE), and isolated intellectual disability (ID) without epilepsy have also been described. KCNQ2-SLFNE is characterized by seizures that start in otherwise healthy infants between two and eight days after term birth and spontaneously disappear between the first and the sixth to 12th month of life. There is always a seizure-free interval between birth and the onset of seizures. Seizures are characterized by sudden onset with prominent motor involvement, often accompanied by apnea and cyanosis; video EEG identifies seizures as focal onset with tonic stiffening of limb(s) and some migration during each seizure's evolution. About 30% of individuals with KCNQ2-SLFNE develop epileptic seizures later in life. KCNQ2-NEO-DEE is characterized by multiple daily seizures beginning in the first week of life that are mostly tonic, with associated focal motor and autonomic features. Seizures generally cease between ages nine months and four years. At onset, EEG shows a burst-suppression pattern or multifocal epileptiform activity; early brain MRI can show basal ganglia hyperdensities and later MRIs may show white matter or general volume loss. Moderate-to-profound developmental impairment is present. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of a KCNQ2-related disorder is established in a proband with suggestive findings and a heterozygous pathogenic variant in KCNQ2 identified by molecular genetic testing.

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Primary familial brain calcification (PFBC) is a neurodegenerative disorder with characteristic calcium deposits in the basal ganglia and other brain areas visualized on neuroimaging. Most affected individuals are in good health during childhood and young adulthood and typically present in the fourth to fifth decade with a gradually progressive movement disorder and neuropsychiatric symptoms. The movement disorder first manifests as clumsiness, fatigability, unsteady gait, slow or slurred speech, dysphagia, involuntary movements, or muscle cramping. Neuropsychiatric symptoms, often the first or most prominent manifestations, range from mild difficulty with concentration and memory to changes in personality and/or behavior, to psychosis and dementia. Seizures of various types occur frequently, some individuals experience chronic headache and vertigo; urinary urgency or incontinence may be present. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of PFBC relies on: visualization of bilateral calcification of the basal ganglia on neuroimaging; presence of progressive neurologic dysfunction; and absence of metabolic, infectious, toxic, or traumatic cause. A family history consistent with autosomal dominant inheritance is often found as well. Thus, the diagnosis of PFBC should be left for those cases where other neurologic or systemic disorders potentially associated with ectopic calcium deposits have not been identified after appropriate examinations. A heterozygous pathogenic variant in PDGFB, PDGFRB, SLC20A2, or XPR1 has been identified in a little more than half of those individuals with a clinical diagnosis of PFBC.

Surveillance: Annual neurologic and neuropsychiatric assessments. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Cautious use of neuroleptic medications as they may exacerbate extrapyramidal symptoms. Genetic counseling PFBC is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Most individuals diagnosed with PFBC have an affected parent identified either clinically or by brain CT scan. However, the transmitting parent may be clinically asymptomatic throughout life or may develop disease manifestations that are later in onset or less severe than those in the proband. If a parent of the proband is affected and/or is known to be heterozygous for a PFBC- related pathogenic variant, sibs of a proband are at a 50% risk of inheriting the pathogenic variant; however, the risk to sibs of being clinically affected may be slightly lower due to reduced penetrance. Offspring of an affected individual have a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant. Prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk is possible if the pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member."

The classic presentation of BTBGD occurs in childhood (age 3-10 years) and is characterized by recurrent subacute encephalopathy manifest as confusion, seizures, ataxia, dystonia, supranuclear facial palsy, external ophthalmoplegia, and/or dysphagia which, if left untreated, can eventually lead to coma and even death. Dystonia and cogwheel rigidity are nearly always present; hyperreflexia, ankle clonus, and Babinski responses are common. Hemiparesis or quadriparesis may be seen. Episodes are often triggered by febrile illness or mild trauma or stress. Simple partial or generalized seizures are easily controlled with anti- seizure medication. An early-infantile Leigh-like syndrome / atypical infantile spasms presentation occurs in the first three months of life with poor feeding, vomiting, acute encephalopathy, and severe lactic acidosis. An adult-onset Wernicke-like encephalopathy presentation is characterized by acute onset of status epilepticus, ataxia, nystagmus, diplopia, and ophthalmoplegia in the second decade of life. Prompt administration of biotin and thiamine early in the disease course results in partial or complete improvement within days in the childhood and adult presentations, but most with the infantile presentation have had poor outcome even after supplementation with biotin and thiamine.

Management GeneReviews Treatment of manifestations: Biotin (5-10 mg/kg/day) and thiamine (up to 40 mg/kg/day with a maximum of 1500 mg daily) are given orally as early in the disease course as possible and are continued lifelong. Symptoms typically resolve within days. Acute encephalopathic episodes may require care in an ICU to manage seizures and increased intracranial pressure; during acute decompensations thiamine may be increased to double the regular dose and be given intravenously. Anti-seizure medication is used to control seizures. Treatment of dystonia is symptomatic and includes administration of trihexyphenidyl or L-dopa. Rehabilitation, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy as needed and adaptation of educational programs to meet individual needs. Education of the family regarding the importance of lifelong adherence to medical therapy. Prevention of primary manifestations: Prompt administration of biotin and thiamine early in the disease course.

Upper limb abnormality can include a combination of thumb hypo- or aplasia and radial hypo- or aplasia and may be asymmetric. Malformation or absence of carpal or metacarpal bones has also been described. Skin lesions may appear anytime within the first few years after birth, typically beginning with erythema of the face and extremities and evolving into poikiloderma.

Disease severity can vary significantly even within the same family. Skin lesions typically appear between the second and fourth decades of life and typically increase in size and number with age. Lung cysts are often bilateral and multifocal; most individuals are asymptomatic but at high risk for spontaneous pneumothorax. Individuals with BHDS are at a sevenfold increased risk for renal tumors that can be bilateral and multifocal; median age of renal tumor diagnosis is 48 years. The most common renal tumors are a hybrid of oncocytoma and chromophobe histologic cell types (oncocytic hybrid tumor) and chromophobe histologic cell types. Some families have renal tumor(s) and/or spontaneous pneumothorax without cutaneous manifestations. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of BHDS is established in a proband with either one major criteria (five or more facial or truncal papules with at least one histologically confirmed fibrofolliculoma or identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in FLCN) or two minor criteria (early-onset [age <50 years] renal cell cancer, multifocal/bilateral renal cell cancer, renal cell cancer with mixed chromophobe/oncocytic histology, multiple lung cysts with or without spontaneous pneumothorax, and/or first degree relative with BHDS). Management Treatment of manifestations: Surgical and laser treatment can lead to temporary improvement of folliculomas, but lesions often recur. Pneumothoraces are treated as in the general population. When possible, nephron- sparing surgery is the treatment of choice for renal tumors, depending on their size and location.

Progressive atrophy and degeneration of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) / choroid lead to symptoms similar to those of other forms of retinal degeneration that fall under the category of retinitis pigmentosa and allied disorders, namely: reduced visual acuity, poor night vision, abnormal retinal electrophysiology, visual field loss, and often impaired color vision. Marked asymmetry between eyes is not uncommon. Onset is typically during the second to third decade of life, but ranges from the early teenage years to beyond the third decade. With time, loss of peripheral visual field, central acuity, or both result in legal blindness in most if not all affected individuals. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of BCD is based on the finding of numerous small, glistening yellow-white retinal crystals associated with atrophy of the RPE, pigment clumps, and sclerosis of the choroidal vessels; variable crystalline deposits in the corneal limbus; varying degrees of rod and cone dysfunction on electroretinography; visual field defects; and reflective dots visualized by spectral domain optical coherence tomography.

    "chunk_text": "Clinical description Individuals with biotinidase deficiency who are diagnosed before they have developed symptoms (e.g., by newborn screening) and who are treated with biotin have normal development. Symptoms including seizures, developmental delay, cutaneous manifestations (skin rash, alopecia), optic atrophy, hearing loss, and respiratory problems occur only in those individuals with biotinidase deficiency prior to biotin treatment. Symptoms of untreated profound biotinidase deficiency (<10% mean normal serum biotinidase activity) usually appear between ages one week and ten years, typically with optic atrophy, hypotonia, seizures, hair loss, and skin rash. Affected children often have ataxia and developmental delay. Individuals with partial biotinidase deficiency (10%-30% of mean normal serum biotinidase activity) may develop symptoms only when stressed, such as during infection. Some symptoms, such as feeding issues, cutaneous manifestations, and respiratory issues, usually resolve with biotin therapy, whereas other manifestations presenting prior to biotin treatment, such as optic atrophy, hearing loss, and developmental delay, may improve but are usually not completely reversible with the initiation of biotin therapy. Untreated adolescents and adults usually exhibit myelopathy and optic neuropathy and are often initially diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. Most of these individuals experience improvement in their symptoms with biotin supplementation. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of biotinidase deficiency is established in a proband whose newborn screening or biochemical findings indicate multiple carboxylase deficiency based on EITHER of the following: Detection of deficient biotinidase enzyme activity in serum/plasma Identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in BTD on molecular genetic testing when the results of enzymatic testing are ambiguous Author Affiliations: 1 Emeritus Chairman, Department of Medical Genetics, Henry Ford Hospital, Detroit, Michigan; Email: barrywolf1@comcast.net. 2 Division of Genetics, Birth Defects and Metabolism, Department of Pediatrics, Ann and Robert H Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois; Email: barrywolf1@comcast.net. Copyright 1993-2024, University of Washington, Seattle. GeneReviews is a registered trademark of the University of Washington, Seattle. All rights reserved. Management GeneReviews Treatment of manifestations: All individuals with profound biotinidase deficiency (<10% mean normal serum enzyme activity) and those with partial biotinidase deficiency (10%-30% of mean normal serum enzyme activity) should be treated with oral biotin in the free form as opposed to the protein-bound form; biotin therapy is lifelong. Targeted therapy: Oral biotin of 5-10 mg/day for those who have <10% mean normal serum enzyme activity and 2.5-10 mg/day in those who have 10%-30% of mean normal serum enzyme activity. Supportive care in symptomatic individuals: Hydration and bicarbonate in those with metabolic decompensation and acidosis, although biotin therapy can rapidly resolve the metabolic derangements within hours to days; supportive developmental therapies and educational resources for those with developmental delay; subspecialist ophthalmologic care for those with optic atrophy; hearing aids and, if severe, consideration of cochlear implants for those with hearing loss. Prevention of primary manifestations: Adherence to biotin therapy can prevent symptom development, and also improves symptoms in symptomatic individuals. Surveillance: Evaluation by a clinical geneticist or metabolic specialist annually for those with profound biotinidase deficiency and every two years for those with partial biotinidase deficiency. If symptoms return with biotin therapy, consider obtaining urine organic acids analysis to evaluate for non-adherence to biotin therapy. Measurement of growth parameters, assessment for new manifestations (seizures, changes in tone, movement disorders), monitoring of developmental progress and educational needs, and assessment for cutaneous manifestations (eczematous rash, alopecia, thrush, and/or candidiasis) at each visit. Ophthalmology and audiology evaluations annually for those with profound biotinidase deficiency and every two years for those with partial biotinidase deficiency. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Raw eggs should be avoided because they contain avidin, an egg white protein that binds biotin, thus decreasing its bioavailability. However, thoroughly cooked eggs present no problem because heating inactivates avidin, rendering it incapable of binding biotin. Evaluation of relatives at risk: If prenatal testing has not been performed, a newborn with an older sib with biotinidase deficiency should be treated at birth with biotin pending results of the definitive biotinidase enzyme activity assay and/or molecular genetic testing (if the BTD pathogenic variants in the family are known). The genetic status of older sibs (even if asymptomatic) of a child with biotinidase deficiency should be clarified by assay of biotinidase enzyme activity or molecular genetic testing (if the BTD pathogenic variants in the family are known) so that biotin therapy can be instituted in a timely manner. Pregnancy management: There have been females with profound biotinidase deficiency who are taking biotin therapy who have had normal pregnancies and offspring. Genetic counseling Biotinidase deficiency is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. If both parents are known to be heterozygous for a BTD pathogenic variant, each sib of an affected individual has at conception a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Molecular genetic carrier testing for at-risk relatives and prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing are possible if the pathogenic variants in the family are known."

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Bloom syndrome (BSyn) is characterized by severe pre- and postnatal growth deficiency, immune abnormalities, sensitivity to sunlight, insulin resistance, and a high risk for many cancers that occur at an early age. Despite their very small head circumference, most affected individuals have normal intellectual ability. Women may be fertile but often have early menopause, and men tend to be infertile, with only one confirmed case of paternity. Serious medical complications that are more common than in the general population and that also appear at unusually early ages include cancer of a wide variety of types and anatomic sites, diabetes mellitus as a result of insulin resistance, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and hypothyroidism. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of BSyn is established in a proband with characteristic clinical features and biallelic pathogenic variants in BLM identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Increased-calorie-density formulas and foods may promote weight gain; consultation with gastroenterologist or feeding specialist and treatment for gastroesophageal reflux disease as needed; standard dietary treatment for dyslipidemia. Skin protection, including avoiding excessive sun exposure, sun-protective clothing and broad-brimmed hat, UV-blocking sunglasses, and use of broad-spectrum sunscreen with SPF of at least 30; standard treatment of skin cancers. Individuals with recurrent infections and defects in humoral immunity may be treated with immunoglobulins to decrease frequency and severity of infections. Developmental services and educational support as needed. In persons with cancer, modification of chemotherapy dosage and duration per oncologist. Fertility treatments as needed; standard treatment of diabetes mellitus and hypothyroidism. Cough assist devices, vibration vests, and daily nasal lavage for mucociliary clearance for bronchiectasis.

Skin exam with a dermatologist upon recognition of suspicious skin lesions and annually thereafter. Assess for recurrent, severe, or opportunistic infections at each visit. Developmental, neurobehavioral, and psychological assessment as needed. Clinical assessment for hematuria and/or abdominal mass and abdominal ultrasound examination every three months until age eight years for Wilms tumor.

Annual fasting blood glucose and hemoglobin A1c beginning at age ten years. Annual serum TSH with reflex to thyroxine beginning at age ten years. Assess for recurrent and/or chronic pulmonary disease at each visit. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Sun exposure to the face and other exposed skin, particularly in infancy and early childhood, should be avoided. Exposure to ionizing radiation should be minimized. Dose reductions and shortened courses of chemotherapy when needed to avoid significant side effects and toxicity (including secondary malignancies). Alkylating agents and radiation therapy are considered high risk and are avoided when possible in those with BSyn. Evaluation of relatives at risk: It is appropriate to evaluate sibs of a proband in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from avoidance of sun exposure and early surveillance for cancer. Genetic counseling BSyn is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. If both parents are known to be heterozygous for a BLM pathogenic variant, each sib of an affected individual has at conception a 25% chance of inheriting biallelic pathogenic variants and being affected, a 50% chance of being a heterozygote (carrier), and a 25% chance of inheriting neither of the familial pathogenic variants. Heterozygotes (carriers) are not at risk of developing BSyn; the cancer risk of heterozygotes as a group remains unclear. Once the BLM pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member, prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing are possible. BSyn is included on most expanded carrier screening panels."

Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of BOFS is established in a proband with characteristic clinical findings and a heterozygous pathogenic variant in TFAP2A identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: In general, children with BOFS should be managed by a multispecialty team including craniofacial specialists, plastic surgeons, otolaryngologists, and speech-language therapists. Small, linear, or superficial branchial skin defects may heal spontaneously; however, some require surgical intervention. Treatment of ophthalmic manifestations is per pediatric ophthalmologist. Nasolacrimal duct stenosis or atresia often requires surgery. Anophthalmia or severe microphthalmia may require a conformer (a structure, usually plastic, inserted into the eye socket to encourage its growth).

The facial features may include microcephaly or trigonocephaly / prominent (but not fused) metopic ridge, hypotonic facies with full cheeks, synophrys, glabellar and eyelid nevus flammeus (simplex), prominent globes, widely set eyes, palate anomalies, and micrognathia. The BOS posture, which is most striking in early childhood and often becomes less apparent with age, is characterized by flexion at the elbows with ulnar deviation and flexion of the wrists and metacarpophalangeal joints. Feeding difficulties in early childhood, including cyclic vomiting, have a significant impact on overall health; feeding tends to improve with age. Seizures are common and typically responsive to standard epileptic medications. Minor cardiac anomalies and transient bradycardia and apnea may be present. Affected individuals may experience recurrent infections, which also tend to improve with age. Isolated case reports suggest that individuals with BOS are at greater risk for Wilms tumor than the general population, but large-scale epidemiologic studies have not been conducted. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of Bohring-Opitz syndrome (BOS) is established in a proband with suggestive clinical features and/or the identification of a constitutional heterozygous pathogenic variant in ASXL1 by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations. Cyclic vomiting may be managed by identification and avoidance of triggers, daily maintenance medication, and early abortive treatment; G-tubes or GJ-tubes may decrease aspiration and improve nutrition.

Standard management is indicated for seizures, congenital heart defects, intellectual disability, myopia, urinary tract infections, urinary retention, and renal stones. Prevention of primary manifestations. Adequate treatment of severe emesis can decrease hospitalizations, infectious exposures, and ascending aspiration. Surveillance: Renal ultrasound every three months from birth to age eight to screen for the development of Wilms tumor; frequent monitoring of growth and development; close monitoring of feeding intolerance with a gastroenterology specialist; regular follow up for vision optimization. Agents/circumstances to avoid. Triggers for vomiting should be avoided and managed with prophylactic antiemetics prior to the exposure. Genetic counseling Bohring-Opitz syndrome (BOS) is typically the result of a de novo pathogenic variant in ASXL1. When BOS results from a de novo variant, the risk to the sibs of a proband is small. No individuals with BOS have been reported to reproduce. Although the vast majority of BOS occurs as the result of a de novo variant in ASXL1, molecular genetic testing can be used to evaluate a pregnancy at theoretically increased risk as a result of constitutional and/or germline mosaicism for an ASXL1 pathogenic variant in a clinically unaffected parent."

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Beta-propeller protein-associated neurodegeneration (BPAN) is typically characterized by early-onset seizures, infantile-onset developmental delay, intellectual disability, absent-to-limited expressive language, motor dysfunction (ataxia), and abnormal behaviors often similar to autism spectrum disorder. Seizure types including generalized (absence, tonic, atonic, tonic-clonic and myoclonic), focal with impaired consciousness, and epileptic spasms, as well as epileptic syndromes (West syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome) can be seen. With age seizures tend to resolve or become less prominent, whereas cognitive decline and movement disorders (progressive parkinsonism and dystonia) emerge as characteristic findings. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of BPAN is established by identifying on molecular genetic testing: In females. A heterozygous WDR45 germline pathogenic variant; In males. Either a hemizygous WDR45 pathogenic variant or partial deletion of WDR45. Somatic mosaicism has been reported in rare females (and possibly in 1 male). Management Treatment of manifestations: Seizure management, tailored to the individual, may include anti-seizure (ASM), ketogenic diet, and/or vagus nerve stimulation. Developmental delays and intellectual disability are managed in infancy and early childhood with early intervention programs and in school-age children with individual education programs.

Motor dysfunction in childhood is managed with physical therapy to maximize mobility and to reduce the risk for later-onset orthopedic complications (e.g., contractures, scoliosis, hip dislocation). Occupational therapy may aid in writing, feeding, grooming, and dressing. For those with feeding difficulties, feeding therapy may be considered. For individuals with social/behavioral difficulties, consider applied behavior analysis (ABA) therapy, medical management strategies in conjunction with a developmental specialist, and pediatric psychiatry consultation to address aggressive or destructive behaviors. In adolescents/adults with parkinsonism, dystonia, and spasticity, the usual pharmacologic agents can be considered with the caveat that these therapies could exacerbate the cognitive deficits that also occur in this age group. Children with abnormal behaviors may qualify for and benefit from interventions used in treatment of autism spectrum disorder. Surveillance: Routine follow up by a neurologist for medication management and interval assessment of ambulation, seizure activity, speech, and evidence of swallowing dysfunction. For those receiving dopaminergic drugs (for parkinsonism), monitor for adverse neuropsychiatric effects and disabling motor fluctuations and dyskinesias. Pregnancy management: Use of ASM during pregnancy for women with a seizure disorder is generally recommended, despite an increased risk for adverse fetal outcome associated with some ASMs. Discussion of the risks and benefits of using a given anti-seizure medication during pregnancy ideally should take place prior to conception. Transitioning to a lower-risk medication may be possible. Genetic counseling BPAN is inherited in an X-linked manner; to date, most affected individuals have been female, and the vast majority are simplex cases (i.e., a single occurrence in a family) resulting from a de novo WDR45 pathogenic variant. The exceptions include two familial cases, one with presumed maternal germline mosaicism and one with transmission of a WDR45 pathogenic variant by a phenotypically normal mother who demonstrated significantly skewed X-chromosome inactivation. Females with the typical BPAN phenotype do not reproduce. In rare instances, a female who is mildly affected may reproduce. Affected males do not reproduce. Once the WDR45 pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing for BPAN are possible."

BPES type I includes the four major features and primary ovarian insufficiency; BPES type II includes only the four major features. Other ophthalmic manifestations that can be associated with BPES include dysplastic eyelids, lacrimal duct anomalies, strabismus, refractive errors, and amblyopia.

Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of BPES is established in a proband with suggestive findings and a heterozygous pathogenic variant in FOXL2 or its regulatory domain identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Management requires the input of a multidisciplinary team of specialists. Eyelid surgery traditionally involves a medial canthoplasty for correction of the blepharophimosis, epicanthus inversus, and telecanthus at age three to five years, typically followed a year later by ptosis correction.

GeneReviews Surveillance: Breast cancer screening in women relies on a combination of monthly breast self-examination, annual or semiannual clinical breast examination, annual mammography, and breast MRI. Annual transvaginal ultrasound and serum CA-125 concentration beginning at age 35 years may be considered for ovarian cancer screening. However, this screening has not been effective in detecting early-stage ovarian cancer, either in high- risk or average-risk women. For men, breast cancer screening includes breast self-examination education and training and annual clinical breast examination beginning at age 35. Annual serum prostate-specific antigen and digital rectal exam screening should begin at age 45. Screening for melanoma should be individualized based on the family history. Screening of asymptomatic individuals for pancreatic cancer is not generally recommended. Evaluation of relatives at risk: Once a cancer-predisposing BRCA1 or BRCA2 germline pathogenic variant has been identified in a family, testing of at-risk relatives can identify those family members who also have the familial pathogenic variant and thus need increased surveillance and specific treatments when a cancer is identified. Genetic counseling BRCA1- and BRCA2-associated HBOC is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. The vast majority of individuals with a BRCA1 or BRCA2 pathogenic variant inherited it from a parent. However, because the penetrance of breast, ovarian, and other cancers associated with pathogenic variants in BRCA1 and BRCA2 is less than 100%, not all individuals with a BRCA1 or BRCA2 pathogenic variant have a parent affected with cancer. The offspring of an individual with a BRCA1 or BRCA2 germline pathogenic variant have a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant.

Brugada syndrome presents primarily during adulthood, although age at diagnosis may range from infancy to late adulthood. The mean age of sudden death is approximately 40 years. Clinical presentations may also include sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS; death of a child during the first year of life without an identifiable cause) and sudden unexpected nocturnal death syndrome (SUNDS), a typical presentation in individuals from Southeast Asia. Other conduction defects can include first-degree AV block, intraventricular conduction delay, right bundle branch block, and sick sinus syndrome. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of Brugada syndrome is established clinically in an individual with characteristic EKG findings and suggestive clinical history and/or family history. A molecular diagnosis can be established in an individual with characteristic features and identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in SCN5A or one of the additional 42 genes associated with Brugada syndrome.

Evaluation of relatives at risk: Identification of relatives at risk using EKG or (if the pathogenic variant in the family is known) molecular genetic testing enables use of preventive measures and avoidance of medications that can induce ventricular arrhythmias. Genetic counseling In most instances Brugada syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner; the exception is KCNE5- related Brugada syndrome, which is inherited in an X-linked manner. Most individuals diagnosed with Brugada syndrome have an affected parent or another affected close relative. The proportion of individuals with Brugada syndrome caused by a de novo pathogenic variant is very low (~1%). Each child of an individual with autosomal dominant Brugada syndrome has a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant. The risk that a child will inherit the familial pathogenic variant and develop Brugada syndrome may be less than 50% because of reduced penetrance and the possibility of other genetic and environmental factors. Reduced penetrance and variable expressivity are hallmarks of Brugada syndrome.

Hearing loss is common and cardiac defects and short stature have been reported. Intellectual disability is rare. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of a TXNL4A-related craniofacial disorder is established in a proband with suggestive findings and biallelic pathogenic variants in TXNL4A identified by molecular genetic testing. All probands described to date have had at least one copy of one of the two partially overlapping 34-bp deletions in the TXNL4A promoter. Management Treatment of manifestations: Neonates with airway compromise at delivery may require intubation or surgical correction of choanal stenosis/atresia. Defects of the lower eyelids that can result in corneal exposure require care by an ophthalmologist to reduce the risk of corneal scarring. Treatment of hearing loss is individualized and may involve hearing aids. Treatment of craniofacial manifestations (e.g., cleft lip and/or palate, preauricular tags, prominent ears) is individualized and managed by a multidisciplinary team. Cardiac defects are managed in a routine manner. Surveillance: Monitoring by an ophthalmologist, audiologist, and craniofacial team is recommended.

The four recognized phenotypes are the three autosomal dominant disorders: Best vitelliform macular dystrophy (BVMD), BEST1 adult-onset vitelliform macular dystrophy (AVMD), and autosomal dominant vitreoretinochoroidopathy (ADVIRC); and autosomal recessive bestrophinopathy (ARB). Onset is usually in the first decade (except AVMD in which onset is age 30 to 50 years). Slow visual deterioration is the usual course. Choroidal neovascularization can occur in rare cases. ADVIRC is also associated with panophthalmic involvement including nanophthalmos, microcornea, hyperopia, and narrow anterior chamber angle with angle closure glaucoma.

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) is a growth disorder variably characterized by macroglossia, hemihyperplasia, omphalocele, neonatal hypoglycemia, macrosomia, embryonal tumors (e.g., Wilms tumor, hepatoblastoma, neuroblastoma, and rhabdomyosarcoma), visceromegaly, adrenocortical cytomegaly, kidney abnormalities (e.g., medullary dysplasia, nephrocalcinosis, and medullary sponge kidney), and ear creases/ posterior helical ear pits. BWS is considered a clinical spectrum, in which affected individuals may have many or only one or two of the characteristic clinical features. Although most individuals with BWS show rapid growth in late fetal development and early childhood, growth rate usually slows by age seven to eight years. Adult heights are typically within the normal range. Hemihyperplasia (also known as lateralized overgrowth) is often appreciated at birth and may become more or less evident over time. Hemihyperplasia may affect segmental regions of the body or selected organs and tissues. Hemihyperplasia may be limited to one side of the body (ipsilateral) or involve opposite sides of the body (contralateral). Macroglossia is generally present at birth and can obstruct breathing or interfere with feeding in infants. Neonatal hypoglycemia occurs in approximately 50% of infants with BWS; most episodes are mild and transient. However, in some cases, persistent hypoglycemia due to hyperinsulinism may require consultation with an endocrinologist for therapeutic intervention. With respect to the increased risk for embryonal tumor development, the risk for Wilms tumor appears to be concentrated in the first seven years of life, whereas the risk for developing hepatoblastoma is concentrated in the first three to four years of life. Cognitive and neurobehavioral development is usually normal. After childhood, prognosis is generally favorable, although some adults experience issues requiring medical management (e.g., for renal or skeletal concerns).

Diagnosis/testing GeneReviews The clinical diagnosis of BWS can be established in a proband who has two tier 1 characteristic clinical findings OR one tier 1 and one tier 2 clinical finding. A diagnosis can also be established in a proband with at least one tier 1 or tier 2 clinical finding AND either: A constitutional epigenetic or genomic alteration leading to an abnormal methylation pattern at 11p15.5 known to be associated with BWS; OR A copy number variant of chromosome 11p15.5 known to be associated with BWS; OR A heterozygous BWS-causing pathogenic variant in CDKN1C. Management Treatment of manifestations: Hypoglycemia is treated with oral feeding if it is mild or with glucose supplementation. Hyperinsulinism is treated with standard pharmacotherapy per endocrinologist; partial pancreatectomy may be considered in those with persistent hypoglycemia who are unresponsive to pharmacologic treatment. Feeding and/or respiratory support (sometimes requiring intubation at birth or tracheostomy for severe respiratory insufficiency) may be needed for those with macroglossia and/or upper airway obstruction. Tongue reduction surgery may be considered for this and other indications. Standard treatment is recommended for omphalocele per pediatric surgeon. A shoe lift may be considered in those with a leg length discrepancy. Epiphysiodesis prior to epiphyseal closure in early puberty may be considered in instances with leg length discrepancy >2 cm; alternatively, leg lengthening of the shorter leg may be considered. For those with hemihyperplasia of the face, referral to a craniofacial center for assessment and potential treatments may be considered. If present, standard treatment is recommended for speech delay/impediment, neoplasia, congenital heart defects, and hypercalciuria / kidney anomalies. Surveillance: Tumor surveillance. Perspectives on screening for malignant tumors in childhood differ based on local, national, and international practices. In North America, proactive tumor screening is recommended when the risk of tumor development exceeds 1%. In many European countries, proactive tumor screening protocols are typically undertaken when the risk of tumor development exceeds 5% and are based on molecular mechanism. For most BWS molecular subtypes, tumor screening consists of abdominal ultrasound with views of the liver, adrenal glands, and kidneys every three months until age four years followed by kidney ultrasound only every three months from age four to seven years. Serum alpha- fetoprotein (AFP) levels are performed every three months until age four years. Physical exam by a pediatrician, geneticist, or pediatric oncologist twice a year is also recommended. Proposed screening for neuroblastoma in children with a heterozygous pathogenic variant in CDKN1C includes abdominal ultrasound, urine vanillylmandelic acid and homovanillic acid, and chest radiograph every three months until age six years, then every six months until age ten years. Non-tumor surveillance includes measurement of growth parameters, assessment for signs/symptoms of sleep apnea, and monitoring of developmental progress / educational needs at each visit; pre-feed serum glucose level per endocrinologist recommendations in neonates and infants with a history of hypoglycemia/hyperinsulinism or random serum glucose level in neonates and infants with signs/ symptoms consistent with hypoglycemia; consideration of blood pressure measurements and measurement of urinary calcium-to-creatinine ratio to screen for occult nephrocalcinosis annually or biannually; consideration of kidney ultrasound to identify findings such as nephrocalcinosis and medullary sponge kidney annually between age eight years and mid-adolescence and periodically in adulthood; assessment of hemihyperplasia and leg length discrepancy at each visit at least until skeletal maturity; dental evaluation with low threshold for orthodontic evaluation as clinically indicated. Syndrome 3 Genetic counseling BWS is associated with abnormal expression of imprinted genes in the BWS critical region. Reliable recurrence risk assessment requires identification of the genetic mechanism in the proband that underlies the abnormal expression of imprinted genes in the BWS critical region. While the majority of families have a recurrence risk of less than 1%, certain underlying genetic mechanisms (e.g., CDKN1C pathogenic variants and copy number variants involving 11p15) may be associated with a recurrence risk as high as 50% depending on the sex of the transmitting parent and the specific alteration. In families with recurrence of BWS, maternally inherited CDKN1C pathogenic variants account for approximately 40% of genetic alterations and paternally or maternally inherited copy number variants account for approximately 9% of genetic alterations. Of note, some individuals with BWS have methylation alterations in the 11p15 imprinted domain as well as in other imprinted loci. For these individuals review of the maternal history should be undertaken for unexplained spontaneous abortion, hydatidiform moles, or a sib with BWS or another imprinting disorder (e.g., Silver-Russell syndrome); in such cases, a homozygous or heterozygous pathogenic variant in maternal effect gene in the mother's genome may confer a significant recurrence risk. Prenatal testing and preimplantation genetic testing: If a genomic variant involving chromosome 11p15.5 (i.e., a cytogenetically visible duplication, inversion, or translocation), copy number variant of 11p15.5, or a CDKN1C pathogenic variant has been identified in the proband, prenatal testing via analysis of fetal DNA from samples obtained by chorionic villus sampling (CVS) or amniocentesis is possible. Preimplantation genetic testing is possible for a familial CDKN1C pathogenic variant and may be possible for some familial genomic variants. For evaluation of fetal methylation status, DNA extracted from amniotic fluid is currently felt to provide the most reliable tissue source, although false negative findings have been reported. Tissue obtained via CVS for prenatal testing for methylation status does not yield reliable results. Genetic counseling should emphasize the potential limitations of prenatal testing for epigenetic alterations."

The phenotypic range includes a prenatal/ congenital form, a subacute infantile form (onset age <1 year), an early childhood-onset form (onset age 1 to <4 years), a late childhood-/juvenile-onset form (onset age 4 to <18 years), and an adult-onset form (onset 18 years). The prenatal/congenital form is characterized by severe encephalopathy. In the later-onset forms initial motor and intellectual development is normal or mildly delayed, followed by neurologic deterioration with a chronic progressive or subacute course. While in childhood-onset forms motor deterioration dominates, in adult-onset forms cognitive decline and personality changes dominate. Chronic progressive decline can be exacerbated by rapid deterioration during febrile illnesses or following head trauma or major surgical procedures, or by acute and extreme fright. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of CACH/VWM can be established in an individual with typical clinical findings, characteristic abnormalities on cranial MRI, and identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in one of five genes (EIF2B1, EIF2B2, EIF2B3, EIF2B4, EIF2B5), which encode the five subunits of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2B (eIF2B).

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase (CACT) is a critical component of the carnitine shuttle, which facilitates the transfer of long-chain fatty acylcarnitines across the inner mitochondrial membrane. CACT deficiency causes a defect in mitochondrial long-chain fatty acid -oxidation, with variable clinical severity. Severe neonatal-onset disease is most common, with symptoms evident within two days after birth; attenuated cases may present in the first months of life. Hyperammonemia and cardiac arrhythmia are prominent in early-onset disease, with high rates of cardiac arrest. Other clinical features are typical for disorders of long-chain fatty acid oxidation: poor feeding, lethargy, hypoketotic hypoglycemia, hypotonia, transaminitis, liver dysfunction with hepatomegaly, and rhabdomyolysis. Univentricular or biventricular hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, ranging from mild to severe, may respond to appropriate dietary and medical therapies. Hyperammonemia is difficult to treat and is an important determinant of long-term neurocognitive outcome. Affected individuals with early-onset disease typically experience brain injury at presentation, and have recurrent hyperammonemia leading to developmental delay / intellectual disability. Affected individuals with later-onset disease have milder symptoms and are less likely to experience recurrent hyperammonemia, allowing a better developmental outcome. Prompt treatment of the presenting episode to prevent hypoglycemic, hypoxic, or hyperammonemic brain injury may allow normal growth and development. Diagnosis/testing Characteristic elevation of long-chain acylcarnitines C16, C18, and C18:1 on acylcarnitine profile suggests a diagnosis of CACT or CPT II deficiency. The diagnosis of CACT deficiency is confirmed by identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in SLC25A20, or in some cases by identifying reduced CACT enzyme activity in skin fibroblasts.

Management GeneReviews Routine daily treatment of manifestations: The mainstay of therapy is a high-carbohydrate diet (>60% of total caloric intake) with restriction of long-chain dietary fat (to <10% of total calories) and treatment with the anaplerotic agent triheptanoin (to provide 25%-35% of total calories). If triheptanoin is not available, medium- chain triglyceride (MCT) oil (10%-30% of total calories) could be used as a substitute. Fasting is avoided or limited, and carnitine supplemented at ~100 mg/kg/day is recommended. Goals of care include optimization of caloric intake to avoid or reduce hyperammonemia (ammonia scavenger medications are of limited efficacy in this condition) and aggressive rehabilitation therapy, including physical and occupational therapy, to address motor delays. Placement of a feeding tube and/or feeding therapy may be required in those with feeding issues. Emergency treatment of manifestations: Administration of high-dextrose-containing fluids: oral/enteral carbohydrate polymer (at home) or intravenous dextrose (in the hospital). Hyperammonemia is most sensitive to high rates of dextrose infusion (12-15 g/kg/day glucose for infants and 10-12 g/kg/day for children age 1-6 years), while ammonia scavenging medications (sodium benzoate, sodium phenylbutyrate) are of limited efficacy. Cardiac arrhythmias, cardiomyopathy, rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal impairment should be treated per standard of care, typically in the intensive care unit. Consideration should be given for triheptanoin treatment in those with cardiogenic shock. Prevention of secondary complications: A home emergency plan for prompt illness management should be provided to parents, primary care providers, teachers, and school staff. When undergoing surgeries or procedures (e.g., dental interventions or neuroimaging requiring sedation), pre-procedure hospital management includes IV dextrose with electrolytes appropriate for age. Provide the family with an emergency plan and letter for use during emergency department visits. Surveillance: Regular evaluations by a metabolic specialist and metabolic dietitian. Measurement of growth parameters (including head circumference) and monitoring of developmental milestones at each visit. Neuropsychological testing using age-appropriate tools as clinically indicated. Laboratory monitoring to include serum ammonia level, total CK level, ALT, AST, glucose, electrolytes, and albumin levels for periodic surveillance as clinically indicated. Measurement of complete blood count, ferritin level, prealbumin, CRP, essential fatty acids, calcium, magnesium, phosphate, copper, zinc, selenium, folate, and vitamins A, D, E, and B12 annually after the first year of life. Measurement of plasma electrolytes, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and/or cystatin C levels for renal monitoring as clinically indicated. Echocardiogram to assess for cardiomyopathy or cardiac dysfunction annually and as clinically indicated. EKG or 24-hour Holter test periodically, as clinically indicated. Consider EEG or neuroimaging in those with new neurologic symptoms or altered mental status. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Prolonged fasting, catabolic illness (fever, intercurrent infection), inadequate caloric provision during times of catabolic stress (including during fasting), prolonged strenuous physical activity, and prolonged administration of anesthetics containing high levels of long-chain fatty acids (e.g., propofol). Evaluation of relatives at risk: Testing of all at-risk sibs of any age is warranted to allow for early diagnosis and treatment of CACT deficiency. For at-risk newborn sibs when prenatal testing was not performed, in parallel with newborn screening either test for the familial SLC25A20 pathogenic variants or measure acylcarnitine profile. Genetic counseling CACT deficiency is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. If both parents are known to be heterozygous for an SLC25A20 pathogenic variant, each sib of an affected individual has at conception a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of inheriting neither of the familial Translocase Deficiency 3 SLC25A20 pathogenic variants and being unaffected. Heterozygotes (carriers) are asymptomatic. Once the SLC25A20 pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member, carrier testing for at-risk relatives and prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing are possible."

In 21-OHD CAH, excessive adrenal androgen biosynthesis results in virilization in all individuals and salt wasting in some individuals. A classic form with severe enzyme deficiency and prenatal onset of virilization is distinguished from a non-classic form with mild enzyme deficiency and postnatal onset. The classic form is further divided into the simple virilizing form (~25% of affected individuals) and the salt-wasting form, in which aldosterone production is inadequate (75% of individuals). Newborns with salt-wasting 21-OHD CAH are at risk for life-threatening salt-wasting crises. Individuals with the non-classic form of 21-OHD CAH present postnatally with signs of hyperandrogenism; females with the non-classic form are not virilized at birth. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of classic 21-OHD CAH is established in newborns with characteristic clinical features, elevated serum 17-OHP, and elevated adrenal androgens. The diagnosis of non-classic 21-OHD is established by comparison of baseline serum 17-OHP and ACTH-stimulated serum 17-OHP or early morning elevated 17- OHP.

Management Treatment of manifestations: Care of children with cleft palate by a craniofacial team using routine measures; in persons with a 46,XY karyotype and undermasculinization of the genitalia, the gonads should be removed because of the increased risk for gonadoblastoma; care of hip subluxation and clubfeet using standard protocols; hearing aids for those with hearing impairment; surgery as needed for cervical vertebral instability and progressive cervicothoracic kyphoscoliosis that compromises lung function. Prevention of secondary complications: If a cervical spine abnormality is identified, special care should be exercised for any surgical procedure. Surveillance: Annual monitoring of spinal curvature.

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Canavan disease is a leukodystrophy characterized by neurodevelopmental delays, macrocephaly, and tone abnormalities. The phenotypic spectrum ranges from the more severe typical Canavan disease (85%-90% of individuals) to the less severe atypical Canavan disease (10%-15%). Typical Canavan disease is characterized by neurodevelopmental impairment evident by ages three to five months, followed by neurodegeneration and developmental regression. The clinical course of atypical Canavan disease is more variable, with neurodevelopmental delay usually becoming evident in the first years of life and frequently followed by developmental regression later in childhood or adolescence. All individuals with Canavan disease have reduced life expectancy, with the majority surviving to age ten years and the minority living to adulthood. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of Canavan disease is established in a proband with suggestive findings either by biochemical testing or by molecular genetic testing. The biochemical diagnosis is established in an individual with suggestive clinical findings and elevated N-acetylaspartic acid (NAA) in urine (using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry) or in the brain by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The molecular diagnosis is established in an individual with suggestive clinical findings and biallelic ASPA pathogenic variants identified by molecular genetic testing. Frequently, both types of testing are performed; turnaround time, which varies among laboratories, should be considered when determining the order of testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Multidisciplinary care by specialists in neurology (to manage spasticity and seizures if present); orthopedics, physical medicine and rehabilitation, physical therapy, and occupational therapy (to minimize contractures, optimize abilities and seating posture); feeding therapy (to assure adequate nutrition and weight gain, minimize risk of aspiration); and education (to support appropriate learning goals).

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics HTRA1 disorder is a phenotypic spectrum in which some individuals have few to no symptoms and others manifest with the more severe CARASIL (cerebral autosomal recessive arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy) phenotype. Those who have a heterozygous HTRA1 pathogenic variant may have mild neurologic findings (sometimes identified only on neuroimaging) or mild-to-moderate neurologic signs and symptoms of CARASIL. In this chapter, the term \\\"classic CARASIL\\\" refers to the more severe phenotype associated with biallelic pathogenic variants, and \\\"HTRA1 cerebral small vessel disease\\\" (HTRA1-CSVD) refers to the milder phenotype associated with a heterozygous HTRA1 pathogenic variant. Classic CARASIL is characterized by early-onset changes in the deep white matter of the brain observed on MRI, and associated neurologic findings. The most frequent initial symptom is gait disturbance from spasticity beginning between ages 20 and 40 years. Forty-four percent of affected individuals have stroke- like episodes before age 40 years. Mood changes (apathy and irritability), pseudobulbar palsy, and cognitive dysfunction begin between ages 20 and 50 years. The disease progresses slowly following the onset of neurologic symptoms. Scalp alopecia and acute mid- to lower-back pain (lumbago) before age 30 years are characteristic. The most frequent initial symptom in individuals with HTRA1-CSVD is slowly progressive gait disturbance after age 40 years, which may be followed by the development of mood changes and cognitive dysfunction. A majority of affected individuals have a stroke-like episode after age 40 years. Spondylosis and alopecia are seen in a minority of individuals with HTRA1-CSVD. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of HTRA1 disorder is established in a proband by identification of either a heterozygous or biallelic pathogenic variant(s) in HTRA1 on molecular genetic testing.

Pale brown to black lentigines are the most common presenting feature of CNC and typically increase in number at puberty. Cardiac myxomas occur at a young age, may occur in any or all cardiac chambers, and can manifest as intracardiac obstruction of blood flow, embolic phenomenon, and/or heart failure. Other sites for myxomas include the skin, breast, oropharynx, and female genital tract. Primary pigmented nodular adrenocortical disease (PPNAD), which causes Cushing syndrome, is the most frequently observed endocrine tumor in CNC, occurring in approximately 25% of affected individuals. Large cell calcifying Sertoli cell tumors (LCCSCTs) are observed in one third of affected males within the first decade and in most adult males. Up to 75% of individuals with CNC have multiple thyroid nodules, most of which are nonfunctioning thyroid follicular adenomas. Clinically evident acromegaly from a growth hormone (GH)- producing adenoma is evident in approximately 10% of adults. Psammomatous melanotic schwannoma (PMS), a rare tumor of the nerve sheath, occurs in an estimated 10% of affected individuals. The median age of diagnosis is 20 years.

Two main types of clinical presentation are seen: Microcephaly with pontine and cerebellar hypoplasia (MICPCH), generally associated with pathogenic loss-of-function variants in CASK X-linked intellectual disability (XLID) with or without nystagmus, generally associated with hypomorphic CASK pathogenic variants MICPCH is typically seen in females with moderate-to-severe intellectual disability, progressive microcephaly with or without ophthalmologic anomalies, and sensorineural hearing loss. Most are able to sit independently; 20%-25% attain the ability to walk; language is nearly absent in most. Neurologic features may include axial hypotonia, hypertonia/spasticity of the extremities, and dystonia or other movement disorders. Nearly 40% have seizures by age ten years. Behaviors may include sleep disturbances, hand stereotypies, and self biting. MICPCH in males may occur with or without severe epileptic encephalopathy in addition to severe-to-profound developmental delay. When seizures are present they occur early and may be intractable. In individuals and families with milder (i.e., hypomorphic) pathogenic variants, the clinical phenotype is usually that of XLID with or without nystagmus and additional clinical features. Males have mild-to-severe intellectual disability, with or without nystagmus and other ocular features. Females typically have normal intelligence with some displaying mild-to-severe intellectual disability with or without ocular features. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of a CASK disorder is established in a female who is heterozygous for a CASK pathogenic variant and in a male who is hemizygous for a CASK pathogenic variant on molecular genetic testing.

Risk to the family members of a proband with a CASK disorder depends on the phenotype (i.e., MICPCH or XLID nystagmus) in the proband. MICPCH. Most affected females and males represent simplex cases (i.e., the only affected family member) and have the disorder as the result of a de novo CASK pathogenic variant. Because heterozygous females manifest the phenotype, an asymptomatic mother is unlikely to be heterozygous for the CASK pathogenic variant. If a proband represents a simplex case, the recurrence risk to sibs appears to be low but greater than that of the general population because of the possibility of parental germline mosaicism. XLID nystagmus. The father of a male with a CASK disorder will not have the disorder nor will he be hemizygous for the CASK pathogenic variant. If a male is the only affected family member, the mother may be a heterozygote or the affected male may have a de novo pathogenic variant. In a family with more than one affected individual, the mother of an affected male is an obligate heterozygote. If the mother of the proband has a CASK pathogenic variant, the chance of transmitting it in each pregnancy is 50%: males who inherit the pathogenic variant will be affected; females who inherit the pathogenic variant will typically be asymptomatic but may have a range of manifestations. If the CASK pathogenic variant cannot be detected in maternal leukocyte DNA, the risk to sibs is greater than that of the general population because of the possibility of parental germline mosaicism.

Males with NSMI have infertility while females have no symptoms. Males with DIS have both infertility and hearing loss, while females have only hearing loss. Routine semen analysis typically identifies abnormalities in sperm number, morphology, and motility. Otologic examination and audiologic assessment can identify hearing loss. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of CATSPER-related NSMI is established in males by the identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in CATSPER1.

The prototype and best understood phenotype is cblC; it is also the most common of these disorders. The age of initial presentation of cblC spans a wide range: In utero with fetal presentation of nonimmune hydrops, cardiomyopathy, and intrauterine growth restriction Newborns, who can have microcephaly, poor feeding, and encephalopathy Infants, who can have poor feeding and slow growth, neurologic abnormality, and, rarely, hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) Toddlers, who can have poor growth, progressive microcephaly, cytopenias (including megaloblastic anemia), global developmental delay, encephalopathy, and neurologic signs such as hypotonia and seizures Adolescents and adults, who can have neuropsychiatric symptoms, progressive cognitive decline, thromboembolic complications, and/or subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of a disorder of intracellular cobalamin metabolism in a symptomatic individual is based on clinical, biochemical, and molecular genetic data. Evaluation of the methylmalonic acid (MMA) level in urine and blood and plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) level are the mainstays of biochemical testing.

Management GeneReviews Treatment of manifestations: Critically ill individuals must be stabilized, preferably in consultation with a metabolic specialist, by treating acidosis, reversing catabolism, and initiating parenteral hydroxocobalamin. Treatment of thromboembolic complications (e.g., HUS and thrombotic microangiopathy) includes initiation of hydroxocobalamin (OHCbl) and betaine or an increase in their doses. Long-term management focuses on improving the metabolic derangement by lowering plasma tHcy and MMA concentrations and maintaining plasma methionine concentrations within the normal range. Gastrostomy tube placement for feeding may be required; infantile spasms, seizures, congenital heart malformations, and hydrocephalus are treated using standard protocols. Prevention of primary manifestations: Early institution of injectable hydroxocobalamin improves survival and may reduce but not completely prevent primary manifestations. To prevent metabolic decompensations, patients are advised to avoid situations that result in catabolism, such as prolonged fasting and dehydration, and always remain on a weight-appropriate dose of hydroxocobalamin. Surveillance: During the first year of life, infants may need to be evaluated once or twice a month by a metabolic specialist to assess growth, nutritional status, feeding ability, and developmental and neurocognitive progress. Toddlers and school-age children should be evaluated at least twice a year to adjust medication dosing (hydroxocobalamin, betaine) during growth and evaluate nutritional status. Teens and adults may be seen on a yearly basis. Routine ophthalmologic, neurologic, and cardiac evaluations may also be appropriate. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Prolonged fasting (longer than overnight without dextrose-containing intravenous fluids); dietary protein intake below the recommended dietary allowance for age or more than that prescribed by a metabolic specialist; methionine restriction including use of medical foods that do not contain methionine; and the anesthetic nitrous oxide. Evaluation of relatives at risk: If the pathogenic variants in the family are known, at-risk sibs may be tested prenatally to allow initiation of treatment in utero or as soon as possible after birth. If the newborn sib of an affected individual has not undergone prenatal testing, molecular genetic testing can be performed in the first week of life if the pathogenic variants in the family are known. Otherwise, evaluation of urine organic acids and plasma amino acids, measurement of total plasma homocysteine, serum methylmalonic acid analysis, and acylcarnitine profile analysis can be used for the purpose of early diagnosis and treatment. Genetic counseling The majority of disorders of intracellular cobalamin metabolism are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. At conception, each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. The disorder of intracellular cobalamin metabolism caused by pathogenic variants in HCFC1 is inherited in an X-linked manner. The risk to sibs depends on the genetic status of the mother. If the mother of the proband has an HCFC1 pathogenic variant, the chance of transmitting it in each pregnancy is 50%. Males who inherit the pathogenic variant will be affected. Females who inherit the pathogenic variant will be heterozygous and will usually not be affected (no affected females have been described to date).

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Cleidocranial dysplasia (CCD) spectrum disorder is a skeletal dysplasia that represents a clinical continuum ranging from classic CCD (triad of delayed closure of the cranial sutures, hypoplastic or aplastic clavicles, and dental abnormalities), to mild CCD, to isolated dental anomalies without other skeletal features. Individuals with classic CCD spectrum disorder typically have abnormally large, wide-open fontanelles at birth that may remain open throughout life. Clavicular hypoplasia can result in narrow, sloping shoulders that can be opposed at the midline. Moderate short stature may be observed, with most affected individuals being shorter than their unaffected sibs. Dental anomalies may include delayed eruption of secondary dentition, failure to shed the primary teeth, and supernumerary teeth. Individuals with CCD spectrum disorder are at increased risk of developing recurrent sinus infections, recurrent ear infections leading to conductive hearing loss, and upper airway obstruction. Intelligence is typically normal. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of CCD spectrum disorder is established in an individual with typical clinical and radiographic findings and/or a heterozygous pathogenic variant in RUNX2 identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: If the cranial vault defect is significant, the head needs protection from blunt trauma; helmets may be used for high-risk activities. Surgical cosmesis for depressed forehead or lengthening of hypoplastic clavicles can be considered. Careful planning of anesthetic management due to craniofacial and dental abnormalities.

The neuropathy is predominantly motor at the onset and results in delays in early motor development, progressing to severe disability by the third decade of life. Secondary foot deformities and scoliosis are common. Sensory neuropathy develops after age ten years. Most affected individuals have a mild nonprogressive intellectual deficit and cerebellar involvement including ataxia, nystagmus, intention tremor, and dysmetria. All have short stature and most have subnormal weight. Adults have hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. Parainfectious rhabdomyolysis (profound muscle weakness, myoglobinuria, and excessively elevated serum concentration of creatine kinase usually following a viral infection) is a potentially life- threatening complication. To date all affected individuals and carriers identified have been from the Romani population. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of CTDP1-CCFDN is established in a proband by identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in CTDP1 on molecular genetic testing.

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Familial cerebral cavernous malformations (FCCM) is a disorder characterized by multiple vascular lesions in the brain and spinal cord that consist of clustered, endothelial-lined caverns ranging in diameter from a few millimeters to several centimeters. Cerebral and/or spinal cavernous malformations may increase in number over time, and individual lesions may increase or decrease in size. The number of cerebral cavernous malformations (CCMs) identified in an individual ranges from one or two to hundreds of lesions (typical number 6-20 CCMs) depending on the individual's age and the quality and type of brain imaging used. Although CCMs have been reported in infants and children, the majority become evident between the second and fifth decades of life either incidentally or associated with seizures, focal neurologic deficits, headaches, and/or cerebral hemorrhage. Cutaneous vascular lesions are found in 9% and retinal vascular lesions in almost 5% of affected individuals. Up to 50% of individuals with FCCM remain symptom free throughout their lives. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of familial cerebral cavernous malformations (FCCM) is established in a proband with multiple CCMs, one CCM and at least one other family member with one or more CCMs, or a heterozygous germline pathogenic variant in KRIT1, CCM2, or PDCD10 identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Surgical removal of symptomatic lesions may be considered in individuals with acute hemorrhage and/or a mass effect presenting with focal neurologic deficit, headache, or seizure or in those with intractable seizures (with or without associated hemorrhage).

GeneReviews Headaches are managed symptomatically and prophylactically. Rehabilitation may aid in management of acute and chronic neurologic deficits. Surveillance: Brain MR imaging with susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) is indicated in individuals experiencing new neurologic manifestations. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Caution is recommended with medications such as analgesics such as NSAIDs, antithrombotic medications such as heparin and warfarin (Coumadin), thrombolytic agents, and oral female hormones. Note: When antithrombotic and thrombolytic medications are necessary for treatment of life- threatening thrombosis, careful consideration of appropriate dosage and close monitoring are warranted. Radiation to the central nervous system may lead to new lesion formation. Evaluation of relatives at risk: Asymptomatic at-risk relatives of all ages may be evaluated by molecular genetic testing if the family-specific pathogenic variant is known to allow early diagnosis and monitoring of individuals at risk of developing CCMs. Symptomatic relatives may undergo brain MRI with SWI sequences to determine presence, size, and location of lesions. Pregnancy management: Pregnant women with FCCM who have had recent brain or spinal cord hemorrhage, epilepsy, or headaches require close monitoring during pregnancy. Seizures are the most common manifestations of CCM hemorrhage during pregnancy; exposure to anti-seizure medication during pregnancy may increase the risk for adverse fetal outcomes but is generally recommended, as the fetal risk is typically less than that associated with an untreated maternal seizure disorder. Any focal neurologic deficits or severe headaches during pregnancy should be evaluated and other neurologic causes (e.g., ischemic stroke, cerebral venous thrombosis) ruled out. Genetic counseling FCCM is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Many individuals diagnosed with FCCM have a symptomatic parent. The proportion of individuals with FCCM caused by a de novo pathogenic variant is unknown. Each child of an individual with FCCM has a 50% chance of inheriting an FCCM-related pathogenic variant. If a pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing of an at-risk pregnancy and preimplantation genetic testing are possible."

Clinical characteristics Central core disease (CCD) is characterized by muscle weakness ranging from mild to severe. Most affected individuals have mild disease with symmetric proximal muscle weakness and variable involvement of facial and neck muscles. The extraocular muscles are often spared. Motor development is usually delayed, but in general, most affected individuals acquire independent ambulation. Life span is usually normal. Severe disease is early in onset with profound hypotonia often accompanied by poor fetal movement, spinal deformities, hip dislocation, joint contractures, poor suck, and respiratory insufficiency requiring assisted ventilation. The outcome ranges from death in infancy to survival beyond age five years. The weakness in CCD is not typically progressive. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of CCD is based on clinical findings of muscle weakness, the histopathologic findings of characteristic cores on muscle biopsy, and molecular genetic testing. Most CCD is associated with pathogenic variants in RYR1, the gene encoding the ryanodine receptor 1. Management Treatment of manifestations: Physical therapy for hypotonia and weakness that may include stretching and mild to moderate low-impact exercise; assistive devices as needed for ambulation; orthopedic surgery as needed for scoliosis, congenital hip dislocation, foot deformities; respiratory support, breathing exercises, chest physiotherapy as needed; dietary supplementation and nasogastric or gastrostomy feeding as needed.

GeneReviews Prevention of secondary complications: Intervention as needed to prevent respiratory compromise from scoliosis; immunization against influenza; prompt treatment of respiratory infection; mobility and physical therapy to prevent joint contractures. Surveillance: Routine assessment of spine for scoliosis, joints for contractures, respiratory parameters (e.g., respiratory rate, peak expiratory flow rate [PEFR], forced vital capacity [FVC], and forced expiratory volume in one second [FEV1]), motor abilities to determine need for physical therapy, occupational therapy, assistive devices; sleep studies when signs of nocturnal hypoxia are present. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Although the actual risk for malignant hyperthermia susceptibility is unknown, it is prudent for individuals with CCD to avoid inhalational anesthetics and succinylcholine. Evaluation of relatives at risk: If the RYR1 pathogenic variant is known, it is appropriate to offer at-risk relatives molecular genetic testing to identify those with possible increased malignant hyperthermia susceptibility. Genetic counseling Central core disease (CCD) is usually inherited in an autosomal dominant (AD) manner but can be inherited in an autosomal recessive (AR) manner. Most individuals diagnosed with AD central core disease have an affected parent or an asymptomatic parent who has a pathogenic variant. The proportion of AD CCD caused by de novo pathogenic variants is unknown. Each child of an individual with AD CCD has a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant. The parents of a child with AR CCD are obligate heterozygotes and therefore carry one mutated allele. Heterozygotes (carriers) are often asymptomatic. At conception, each sib of an individual with AR CCD has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Prenatal diagnosis for pregnancies at increased risk for AD or AR CCD is possible once the pathogenic variant(s) have been identified in an affected family member."

The clinical manifestations and course are highly variable, ranging from infants who die in the first year of life to mildly affected adults. Clinical findings tend to be similar in sibs. In the infantile multisystem presentation, infants show axial hypotonia, hyporeflexia, esotropia, and developmental delay. Feeding issues, vomiting, faltering growth, and developmental delay are frequently seen. Subcutaneous fat may be excessive over the buttocks and suprapubic region. Two distinct clinical courses are observed: (1) a nonfatal neurologic course with faltering growth, strabismus, developmental delay, cerebellar hypoplasia, and hepatopathy in infancy followed by neuropathy and retinitis pigmentosa in the first or second decade; and (2) a more severe neurologic-multivisceral course with approximately 20% mortality in the first year of life. The late-infantile and childhood ataxiaintellectual disability stage, which begins between ages three and ten years, is characterized by hypotonia, ataxia, severely delayed language and motor development, inability to walk, and IQ of 40 to 70; other findings include seizures, stroke-like episodes or transient unilateral loss of function, coagulopathy, retinitis pigmentosa, joint contractures, and skeletal deformities. In the adult stable disability stage, intellectual ability is stable; peripheral neuropathy is variable, progressive retinitis pigmentosa and myopia are seen, thoracic and spinal deformities with osteoporosis worsen, and premature aging is observed; females may lack secondary sexual development and males may exhibit decreased testicular volume. Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and coagulopathy may occur. The risk for deep venous thrombosis is increased.

Diagnosis/testing GeneReviews The diagnosis of PMM2-CDG is established in a proband with type I transferrin isoform analysis and identification of either biallelic pathogenic variants in PMM2 on molecular genetic testing or (if results of molecular genetic testing are uncertain) low levels of phosphomannomutase (PMM) enzyme activity. Management Treatment of manifestations: Symptomatic treatment for severe infantile phase in a pediatric tertiary care center. Optimal routine care in infants and children should maximize caloric intake including: use of a nasogastric tube or gastrostomy tube, anti-gastroesophageal reflux measures, speech and oral motor therapy to aid transition to oral feeds. Standard treatment for seizures; occupational therapy, physical therapy, and speech therapy for developmental delay. In all affected individuals care should include standard treatment of ocular and vision issues and cardiac issues; treatment of bleeding disorders and/or coagulopathy per hematologist with consultation with surgeon prior to surgeries; hydration for stroke-like episodes with physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy during the recovery period; standard management of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) with education regarding risk of DVT; treatment of hypothyroidism, hypoglycemia, and other endocrinopathies per endocrinologist. Multicystic kidneys are managed conservatively; standard treatments for other renal issues; counseling regarding avoidance of fracture; orthopedic intervention for scoliosis; rehabilitation medicine services including wheelchairs, transfer devices, physical therapy, and educational adaptation as needed; management of immune dysfunction per immunologist; education for life skills, vocational training, independent self-care, and activities of daily living; parental support for long-term care planning. Surveillance: At each visit assess growth, nutritional status, safety of oral intake, seizures, and developmental progress; ophthalmology evaluations every one to two years; cardiology assessment as needed; annual AST, ALT, and albumin until normalization; liver ultrasound every three to five years; measure TSH, free T4, and glucose every one to two years; assess gonadal function at pubertal age as recommended by endocrinologist; blood pressure, urine dipstick for proteinuria, and serum creatinine every one to two years or as needed; assessment for osteopenia every one to two years; orthopedic assessment if scoliosis becomes evident; complete blood count and differential every one to two years; annual assessment of bleeding and clotting parameters by a hematologist including prothrombin time, protein C, protein S, antithrombin III, factor IX, and factor XI. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Cautious use of acetaminophen and other agents metabolized by the liver if significant liver insufficiency is present. Genetic counseling PMM2-CDG is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. At conception, the theoretic risks to sibs of an affected individual are a 25% risk of being affected, a 50% risk of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% risk of being unaffected and not a carrier; however, based on outcomes of at-risk pregnancies, the risk of having an affected child is closer to 1/3 than to the expected 1/4. Carrier testing for at-risk family members and prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk are possible if both PMM2 pathogenic variants in the family have been identified."

Movement disorders include chorea, dystonia, and stereotypical hand and leg movements. Although females are more commonly affected than males (female-to-male ratio is approximately 4:1), the severity of manifestations in heterozygous females and hemizygous males can be equivalent. However, the severity of the phenotype can vary depending on the type and position of the CDKL5 pathogenic variant, pattern of X-chromosome inactivation in females, and presence of postzygotic mosaicism in males or females, who can have mild manifestations. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of CDD is established in a female proband with suggestive clinical findings and a heterozygous CDKL5 pathogenic variant identified by molecular genetic testing.

Management GeneReviews Treatment of manifestations: International consensus recommendations for the assessment and management of individuals with CDD have been published. The management of individuals with CDD is complex and requires multiple specialty evaluations; referral to a CDKL5 Center of Excellence may allow families to coordinate care more easily for affected individuals. Targeted therapy: Ztalmy (ganaxolone) is a targeted therapy for the treatment of epilepsy associated with CDD in individuals aged two years and older. This is the first approved treatment for seizures associated with CDD and the first treatment specifically for CDD. Supportive care: Multidisciplinary care by specialists in the fields of pediatric neurology including pediatric epilepsy, feeding and nutrition, sleep disorders, behavioral disorders, orthopedics, physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech-language disorders, and genetic counseling. Surveillance: Annual assessments by a medical home / primary care physician and specialists. Genetic counseling CDD is inherited in an X-linked manner. Approximately 99% of affected individuals represent simplex cases (i.e., a single occurrence in the family). The majority of individuals who represent simplex cases have the disorder as the result of a de novo germline or (rarely) postzygotic CDKL5 pathogenic variant. Rarely, an individual with CDD has the disorder as the result of a CDKL5 pathogenic variant inherited from a heterozygous or mosaic mother. If the mother of the proband has a CDKL5 pathogenic variant, the chance of transmitting it in each pregnancy is 50%. Females who inherit the pathogenic variant will be heterozygous and are at high risk of being affected, although skewed X-chromosome inactivation and the possibility of other attenuating factors may result in a variable phenotype. Males who inherit the pathogenic variant will be hemizygous and will most likely be severely affected. Once the CDKL5 pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing are possible."

Severe (classic) CdLS is characterized by distinctive facial features, growth restriction (prenatal onset; <5th centile throughout life), hypertrichosis, and upper-limb reduction defects that range from subtle phalangeal abnormalities to oligodactyly (missing digits). Craniofacial features include synophrys, highly arched and/or thick eyebrows, long eyelashes, short nasal bridge with anteverted nares, small widely spaced teeth, and microcephaly. Individuals with a milder phenotype have less severe growth, cognitive, and limb involvement, but often have facial features consistent with CdLS. Across the CdLS spectrum IQ ranges from below 30 to 102 (mean: 53). Many individuals demonstrate autistic and self-destructive tendencies. Other frequent findings include cardiac septal defects, gastrointestinal dysfunction, hearing loss, myopia, and cryptorchidism or hypoplastic genitalia. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of CdLS is established in a proband with suggestive clinical features and/or by identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in NIPBL, RAD21, SMC3, or BRD4, or a hemizyous pathogenic variant in HDAC8 or SMC1A by molecular genetic testing.

If surgery is being considered, malignant hyperthermia precautions and preoperative evaluation for thrombocytopenia and cardiac disease with careful monitoring of the airway during anesthesia are recommended. Surveillance: At each visit: measurement of growth parameters and evaluation of nutritional status and safety of oral intake; monitor for signs and symptoms of GERD and for evidence of aspiration with respiratory insufficiency; assessment for new manifestations such as seizures or signs of autonomic dysfunction; monitor developmental progress and educational needs; behavioral assessment for anxiety, attention, and aggressive or self-injurious behavior; assessment of mobility and self-help skills. At least annually: ophthalmology evaluation; dental evaluation with cleaning; audiology evaluation in childhood and adolescence. Genetic counseling NIPBL-CdLS, RAD21-CdLS, SMC3-CdLS and BRD4-CdLS are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner; HDAC8-CdLS and SMC1A-CdLS are inherited in an X-linked manner. The majority of affected individuals have a de novo heterozygous pathogenic variant in NIPBL. Fewer than 1% of individuals with autosomal dominant CdLS have an affected parent. When the parents are clinically unaffected, the risk to the sibs of a proband with CdLS is estimated to be 1.5% because of the possibility of germline mosaicism. The risk to sibs of a male proband with X-linked CdLS depends on the status of the proband's mother; the risk to sibs of a female proband with X- linked CdLS depends on the status of the proband's mother and father. Prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible for families in which the pathogenic variant has been identified."

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Systemic primary carnitine deficiency (CDSP) is a disorder of the carnitine cycle that results in defective fatty acid oxidation. It encompasses a broad clinical spectrum including the following: Metabolic decompensation in infancy typically presenting between age three months and two years with episodes of hypoketotic hypoglycemia, poor feeding, irritability, lethargy, hepatomegaly, elevated liver transaminases, and hyperammonemia triggered by fasting or common illnesses such as upper respiratory tract infection or gastroenteritis Childhood myopathy involving heart and skeletal muscle with onset between age two and four years Pregnancy-related decreased stamina or exacerbation of cardiac arrhythmia Fatigability in adulthood Absence of symptoms The latter two categories often include mothers diagnosed with CDSP after newborn screening has identified low carnitine levels in their infants. Diagnosis/testing Plasma carnitine levels are extremely reduced in CDSP. The diagnosis is established by identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in SLC22A5 or demonstration of reduced fibroblast carnitine transport. Management Treatment of manifestations: Metabolic decompensation and skeletal and cardiac muscle function improve with 100-400 mg/kg/day oral levocarnitine (L-carnitine) if it is started before irreversible organ damage occurs. Hypoglycemic episodes are treated with intravenous dextrose infusion; cardiomyopathy requires management by specialists in cardiology.

GeneReviews Prevention of primary manifestations: Maintain appropriate plasma carnitine concentrations with oral L- carnitine supplementation; prevent hypoglycemia with frequent feeding and avoiding fasting. Hospitalization for intravenous glucose administration for individuals who are required to fast for a procedure or who cannot tolerate oral intake due to illness such as gastroenteritis. Prevention of secondary complications: Oral metronidazole and/or decreasing the carnitine dose usually results in the resolution of the fishy odor due to L-carnitine supplementation. Surveillance: Echocardiogram and electrocardiogram: annually during childhood and less frequently in adulthood; monitor plasma carnitine concentration frequently until levels reach the normal range, then, measure three times a year during infancy and early childhood, twice a year in older children, and annually in adults; evaluate serum creatine kinase concentration and liver transaminases during acute illnesses. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Fasting longer than age-appropriate periods. Evaluation of relatives at risk: Measure plasma carnitine levels in sibs of an affected individual. Pregnancy management: Pregnant women with CDSP require close monitoring of plasma carnitine levels and increased carnitine supplementation as needed to maintain normal plasma carnitine levels. Genetic counseling CDSP is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. At conception, each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier.

Most affected children develop nephronophthisis that often leads to end-stage kidney disease in infancy or childhood, a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Hepatic fibrosis and retinal dystrophy are also observed. Dolichocephaly, often secondary to sagittal craniosynostosis, is a primary manifestation that distinguishes CED from most other ciliopathies. Brain malformations and developmental delay may also occur. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of CED is established in a proband with characteristic clinical and radiographic features (including two frequent features and two other abnormalities, with at least one ectodermal defect i.e., involvement of the teeth, hair, or nails) and/or by identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in one of the six genes currently known to be associated with CED: IFT43, IFT52, IFT122, IFT140, WDR19, or WDR35.

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics CEBPA-associated familial acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is defined as the presence of a heterozygous germline CEBPA pathogenic variant in an individual with AML and/or family in which more than one individual has AML. In contrast, sporadic CEBPA-associated AML is defined as AML in which a CEBPA pathogenic variant(s) is identified in leukemic cells but not in the non-leukemic cells. In the majority of individuals, the age of onset of familial AML appears to be earlier than sporadic AML; disease onset has been reported in persons as young as age 1.8 years and up to age 50 years. The prognosis of CEBPA-associated familial AML appears to be favorable compared with sporadic CEBPA-associated AML. Individuals with CEBPA-associated familial AML who have been cured of their initial disease may be at greater risk of developing additional independent leukemic episodes, in addition to the risk of relapse from preexisting clones. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of CEBPA-associated familial AML is established by identification of a heterozygous germline CEBPA pathogenic variant in a specimen that contains only non-leukemic cells from an individual and/or family with AML. Management Treatment of manifestations: Treatment usually includes cytarabine/anthracycline-based induction and cytarabine-based consolidation chemotherapy. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) from a volunteer unrelated donor or appropriately screened family member should be reserved for individuals failing to achieve remission following standard induction therapy or for disease recurrence.

Onset in most affected individuals occurs at birth or early infancy. The first manifestation is often pink-to-dark red discoloration of the urine. Hemolytic anemia is common and can range from mild to severe, with some affected individuals requiring chronic blood transfusions. Porphyrin deposition may lead to corneal ulcers and scarring, reddish-brown discoloration of the teeth (erythrodontia), and bone loss and/or expansion of the bone marrow. The phenotypic spectrum, however, is broad and ranges from nonimmune hydrops fetalis in utero to late-onset disease with only mild cutaneous manifestations in adulthood. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of CEP in a proband with suggestive clinical and biochemical findings is most commonly established by identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in UROS, and on rare occasion by identification of a hemizygous pathogenic variant in the X-linked gene GATA1. Management Treatment of manifestations: There is no FDA-approved treatment for CEP or specific treatment for the photosensitivity. Currently, the only effective management is prevention of blistering by avoidance of sun and light exposure, including the long-wave ultraviolet light that passes through window glass or is emitted from artificial light sources.

However, instances of familial recurrence of CFC have been reported. Each child of an individual with CFC syndrome has a 50% chance of inheriting the BRAF, MAP2K1, MAP2K2, or KRAS pathogenic variant. Once the CFC syndrome-causing pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing for CFC are possible."

Clinical characteristics Congenital fiber-type disproportion (CFTD) is usually characterized by hypotonia and mild-to-severe generalized muscle weakness at birth or within the first year of life. Although some individuals remain non- ambulatory throughout life, many eventually develop the ability to walk. In more than 90% of affected individuals, muscle weakness is static or improves; in the remainder it is usually slowly progressive. Mild-to- severe respiratory involvement is seen in approximately 30% of affected individuals; respiratory failure may occur at any age. Ophthalmoplegia, ptosis, and facial and/or bulbar weakness with severe limb/respiratory weakness may predict a poor prognosis. Mild-to-severe feeding difficulties occur in nearly 30% of children. Contractures of the hips, knees, ankles, elbows, and fingers occur in approximately 25% and may be present at birth or occur in older persons with decreased mobility secondary to severe weakness. Spinal deformities including scoliosis, kyphoscoliosis, and lordosis are seen in 25% or more of individuals. Diagnosis/testing Diagnosis is based on a combination of clinical presentation and morphologic features observed on skeletal muscle histology. The pathologic and clinical manifestations of CFTD overlap with other neuromuscular and non-neuromuscular diseases that must be ruled out prior to making a diagnosis of CFTD.

GeneReviews variants have been identified in six genes: ACTA1 (~6% of individuals with CFTD), MYH7 (unknown), RYR1 (~10%-20%), SELENON (SEPN1) (rare), TPM2 (rare), and TPM3 (~20%-25% of individuals with CFTD). Management Treatment of manifestations: For weakness/contractures: physical therapy and occupational therapy (orthotics or splinting, serial casting, or walking supports/wheelchair); regular low-impact exercise, stretching, and submaximal strength training with sufficient rest to avoid exhaustion; for respiratory issues: breathing exercises, chest physiotherapy, seating assessment, immunizations, antibiotics for chest infections, tracheostomy, or ventilatory support; for feeding/swallowing difficulties: speech therapy, and gavage or gastrostomy feedings; orthopedic evaluation for foot deformities, joint contractures, and scoliosis; bracing or spinal fusion based on progression of the spinal curve and effect on pulmonary and motor function; treatment by a cardiologist as needed; orthodontia as needed. Prevention of secondary complications: Consider precautions for malignant hyperthermia prior to anesthesia; preoperative assessment of pulmonary and cardiac function; consistent joint movement to prevent contractures. Surveillance: Regular monitoring of motor abilities/weakness, pulmonary and cardiac function, and spine for scoliosis (especially in childhood and adolescence). Agents/circumstances to avoid: Extended immobilization. Genetic counseling CFTD is a genetically heterogeneous condition that can be inherited in an autosomal recessive, autosomal dominant, or X-linked manner. To date, all identified cases of ACTA1, MYH7, and TPM2-related CFTD have been caused by autosomal dominant pathogenic variants while the SELENON and RYR1-related cases have been associated with autosomal recessive pathogenic variants. TPM3-related CFTD can be inherited in an autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive manner. ACTA1 and TPM3 pathogenic variants are often de novo dominant. A large portion of individuals with CFTD represent simplex cases (i.e., a single occurrence in a family). It can be difficult to determine inheritance pattern in the family of a simplex case when a pathogenic variant is not identified through testing of known genes. Prenatal testing for pregnancies at risk for CFTD is possible if the pathogenic variant(s) in a family are known."

Age at death ranges from 28 to 61 years; several instances of sudden unexplained death or death during epileptic seizures have been reported. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of VPS13A disease is established in a proband with suggestive findings and biallelic pathogenic variants in VPS13A identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: There is no cure for VPS13A disease. Supportive treatment to improve quality of life, maximize function, and reduce complications is recommended. This ideally involves multidisciplinary care by specialists in relevant fields of neurology, psychiatry, physiatry, physical therapy (PT), occupational therapy (OT), speech-language therapy, feeding, neuropsychology, and medical genetics. Pharmacotherapy for movement disorders may include dopamine antagonists/depleters such as atypical neuroleptics or tetrabenazine (or its derivatives) for limb and trunk dystonia and orofaciolingual dystonia (which may also benefit from botulinum toxin). Issues with mobility, activities of daily living, and need for assistive devices can be addressed by physiatry, PT, and OT. In persons with dysphagia, feeding assistance can include speech therapy and gastrostomy tube placement as needed to reduce weight loss and/or risk of aspiration. For dysarthria or mutism, therapy can include the use of technical means for augmentative and alternative communication, such as speech-generating devices. Seizure management can include use of phenytoin, clobazam, valproate, and levetiracetam. For psychiatric/behavioral issues, antidepressant or antipsychotic medications are used per conventional approaches. Surveillance: Regular monitoring of existing manifestations, the individual's response to pharmacotherapy and other supportive care, and the emergence of new manifestations is recommended per the multidisciplinary treating specialists. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Seizure-provoking circumstances (e.g., sleep deprivation, alcohol intake) and anticonvulsants that may worsen involuntary movements (e.g., carbamazepine, lamotrigine). Genetic counseling VPS13A disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. If both parents are known to be heterozygous for a VPS13A pathogenic variant, each sib of an affected individual has at conception a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Once the VPS13A pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member, carrier testing for at- risk relatives, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk, and preimplantation genetic testing are possible."

Typical facial features are depressed nasal bridge and broad flat nasal tip, widely spaced eyes, downslanted palpebral fissures, mild ptosis, short philtrum with prominent philtral ridges with an upward pointing vermilion border resulting in a triangular mouth, and thickened (patulous) everted lips. Less common findings include other types of congenital heart defects, other hand and foot anomalies, hypodontia, hearing loss, myopia and/or strabismus, polythelia, parasomnia, craniosynostosis (involving either the metopic or sagittal suture), and short stature. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of Char syndrome is established in a proband with suggestive clinical findings and/or a heterozygous pathogenic variant in TFAP2B identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Management of patent ductus arteriosus after the immediate newborn period is determined by the degree of shunting from the aorta to the pulmonary artery; options are surgical ligation or ductal occlusion at catheterization. Hypodontia/tooth anomalies, vision problems, hearing loss, other hand/foot anomalies, parasomnias, and craniosynostosis are treated in a routine manner.

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics CHD7 disorder encompasses the entire phenotypic spectrum of heterozygous CHD7 pathogenic variants that includes CHARGE syndrome as well as subsets of features that comprise the CHARGE syndrome phenotype. The mnemonic CHARGE syndrome, introduced in the premolecular era, stands for coloboma, heart defect, choanal atresia, retarded growth and development, genital hypoplasia, ear anomalies (including deafness). Following the identification of the genetic cause of CHD7 disorder, the phenotypic spectrum expanded to include cranial nerve anomalies, vestibular defects, cleft lip and/or palate, hypothyroidism, tracheoesophageal anomalies, brain anomalies, seizures, and renal anomalies. Life expectancy highly depends on the severity of manifestations; mortality can be high in the first few years when severe birth defects (particularly complex heart defects) are present and often complicated by airway and feeding issues. In childhood, adolescence, and adulthood, decreased life expectancy is likely related to a combination of residual heart defects, infections, aspiration or choking, respiratory issues including obstructive and central apnea, and possibly seizures. Despite these complications, the life expectancy for many individuals can be normal. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of CHD7 disorder is established in a proband with suggestive clinical and imaging findings and a heterozygous pathogenic variant in or deletion of CHD7 identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Management of the manifestations of CHD7 disorder can be complex and require a multidisciplinary approach involving clinicians, therapists, and educators. Surveillance: Requires routine follow up of manifestations identified in infancy/childhood, as well as ongoing monitoring of growth, development, educational progress, behavior, and possible endocrine issues.

Genetic counseling CHD7 disorder is an autosomal dominant disorder typically caused by a de novo pathogenic variant. In rare instances, an individual with CHD7 disorder inherits a pathogenic variant from a heterozygous parent. The risk to the sibs of the proband depends on the genetic status of the proband's parents: (1) If a parent of the proband has a CHD7 pathogenic variant, the risk to the sibs of inheriting the pathogenic variant is 50%; (2) If the CHD7 pathogenic variant identified in the proband cannot be detected in the leukocyte DNA of either parent, the empiric recurrence risk to sibs of a proband is approximately 1%-2% because of the possibility of parental germline mosaicism. Although many individuals with CHD7 disorder are not able to reproduce, each child of an individual with CHD7 disorder has a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant. Once the CHD7 pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing are possible."

While present in nearly all individuals with CHS, these clinical findings vary in severity. Of note, all individuals with CHS are at risk of developing neurologic manifestations and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). Individuals with severe childhood-onset presentations are considered to have \\\"classic\\\" CHS, whereas individuals with milder adolescent- to adult-onset presentations are considered to have \\\"atypical\\\" CHS. Because of the considerable overlap between classic CHS and atypical CHS, the disorder is best understood as a continuum of severe to milder phenotypes, with the universal feature being the pathognomonic giant granules within leukocytes observed on peripheral blood smear. Diagnosis/testing The clinical diagnosis of CHS is established in a proband with suggestive clinical findings by identification of the pathognomonic giant granules within leukocytes on peripheral blood smear and/or biallelic pathogenic variants in LYST on molecular genetic testing.

Management GeneReviews Targeted therapy: The only targeted therapy currently available is hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). HSCT can correct the hematologic and immunologic manifestations of CHS but does not appear to protect against the development of neurologic manifestations. Supportive care: Multidisciplinary care is recommended, including specialists in ophthalmology and low vision services, infectious disease for management and prevention, hematology (to manage the bleeding disorder, HSCT, and treatment of HLH), neurology and physiatry, physical therapy, occupational therapy, and (for children) neuropsychology or developmental pediatrics to address educational and emotional needs or (for adults) neuropsychology. Surveillance: To monitor existing manifestations, the individual's response to supportive care, and the emergence of new manifestations, routinely scheduled follow-up evaluations by the multidisciplinary specialists are recommended. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Live vaccines given the risk of infection due to immunodeficiency; all nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (e.g., aspirin, ibuprofen) given the risk of exacerbating the bleeding tendency. Evaluation of relatives at risk: It is appropriate to evaluate the older and younger sibs of a proband as early as possible. Early diagnosis may provide the opportunity to perform HSCT prior to the development of HLH. Pregnancy management: Although data are limited, to date females with CHS report uneventful pregnancy, labor, and delivery. However, because of concerns about bleeding during delivery and the postpartum period, developing a plan prior to delivery to address this issue is recommended. Genetic counseling CHS is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. If both parents are known to be heterozygous for a LYST pathogenic variant, each sib of an affected individual has at conception a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier.

    "_id": "cherubism",
    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Cherubism is a childhood-onset, autoinflammatory bone disease characterized by bilateral and symmetric proliferative fibroosseous lesions limited to the mandible and maxilla. The enlargement is usually symmetric in nature. The phenotype ranges from no clinical manifestations to severe mandibular and maxillary overgrowth with respiratory, vision, speech, and swallowing problems. In most affected persons, teeth are displaced, unerupted, unformed, or absent, or may appear to be floating in cystlike spaces; malocclusion, premature exfoliation of deciduous teeth, and root resorption have also been reported. The course and duration of the active process of bone destruction varies between affected individuals; the onset is usually in early childhood, and typically new lesions can occur until puberty. Regression of the lesions occurs as they become filled with bone and remodel during the second and third decade of life. By age 30 years, the facial abnormalities associated with cherubism are not usually recognizable and residual deformity of the jaws is rare. Typically, cherubism is an isolated benign condition; the affected person has normal intellectual skills and is without other physical anomalies. Diagnosis/testing Diagnosis is established in a proband with typical clinical, radiographic, and histologic findings and/or a heterozygous pathogenic variant in SH3BP2 identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Given that cherubism is considered to be a self-limited condition that improves over time, treatment should be tailored to the individual's presentation and the evolution of the disease. Ongoing management by a craniofacial team in a major pediatric medical center is recommended; depending on the severity, surgery may be needed for functional and esthetic concerns.

Other findings include joint hypermobility, fine, silky hair, immunodeficiency, anemia, increased risk for malignancy, gastrointestinal dysfunction, and impaired spermatogenesis. The most severe phenotype, AD, has the most pronounced skeletal phenotype, may be associated with atlantoaxial subluxation in the newborn, and may include cognitive deficiency. The clinical manifestations of the CHH-AD spectrum disorders are variable, even within the same family. Diagnosis/testing Diagnosis of a CHH-AD spectrum disorder is established in a proband with characteristic clinical and radiographic findings. If clinical and radiographic findings are inconclusive, identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in RMRP by molecular genetic testing can confirm the diagnosis and allow for family studies.

Males with CS typically present with developmental delay, later meeting criteria for severe intellectual disability (ID). Behaviorally, autism spectrum disorder and hyperactivity are common, and may resemble the behaviors observed in Angelman syndrome. Hypotonia and oropharyngeal dysphagia in infancy may result in failure to thrive. Seizures, typically beginning before age three years, can include infantile spasms and tonic, tonic-clonic, myoclonic, and atonic seizures. Subsequently, regression (e.g., loss of ambulation and ability to feed independently) may occur. Manifestations in heterozygous females range from asymptomatic to mild ID and/or behavioral issues. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of CS is established in a male proband by identification of a hemizygous pathogenic variant in SLC9A6 on the X chromosome and in a female proband by identification of a heterozygous SLC9A6 pathogenic variant on molecular genetic testing.

Affected newborns typically have mild-to-moderate hypotonia, feeding difficulties, and poor head control. During the first years, neurologic examination typically demonstrates poor visual tracking and response to sounds, axial hypotonia, and mild distal spasticity that can transition over time to more severe spasticity. Seizures occur in more than 90% of individuals with lissencephaly and often include infantile spasms. Seizures are often drug resistant, but even with good seizure control, the best developmental level achieved (excluding the few individuals with partial lissencephaly) is the equivalent of about age three to five months. In individuals with PAFAH1B1-related lissencephaly/SBH, developmental delay ranges from mild to severe.

Genetic counseling Individuals diagnosed with isolated PAFAH1B1-related lissencephaly/SBH typically have the disorder as the result of a de novo genetic alteration (an intragenic PAFAH1B1 pathogenic variant or, rarely, a chromosome rearrangement that disrupts PAFAH1B1). In rare families, an individual with PAFAH1B1-related lissencephaly/SBH has the disorder as the result of autosomal dominant inheritance of a PAFAH1B1 pathogenic variant from a parent. If the intragenic PAFAH1B1 pathogenic variant identified in the proband is not identified in either parent, the recurrence risk for a future pregnancy is slightly greater than that of the general population because of the possibility of parental germline mosaicism.

Often citrin deficiency is characterized by strong preference for protein-rich and/or lipid-rich foods and aversion to carbohydrate-rich foods. NICCD. Children younger than age one year have a history of low birth weight with growth restriction and transient intrahepatic cholestasis, hepatomegaly, diffuse fatty liver, and parenchymal cellular infiltration associated with hepatic fibrosis, variable liver dysfunction, hypoproteinemia, decreased coagulation factors, hemolytic anemia, and/or hypoglycemia. NICCD is generally not severe and symptoms often resolve by age one year with appropriate treatment, although liver transplantation has been required in rare instances. FTTDCD. Beyond age one year, many children with citrin deficiency develop a protein-rich and/or lipid- rich food preference and aversion to carbohydrate-rich foods. Clinical abnormalities may include growth restriction, hypoglycemia, pancreatitis, severe fatigue, anorexia, and impaired quality of life. Laboratory changes are dyslipidemia, increased lactate-to-pyruvate ratio, higher levels of urinary oxidative stress markers, and considerable deviation in tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle metabolites. One or more decades later, some individuals with NICCD or FTTDCD develop CTLN2. CTLN2. Presentation is sudden and usually between ages 20 and 50 years. Manifestations are recurrent hyperammonemia with neuropsychiatric symptoms including nocturnal delirium, aggression, irritability, hyperactivity, delusions, disorientation, restlessness, drowsiness, loss of memory, flapping tremor, convulsive seizures, and coma. Symptoms are often provoked by alcohol and sugar intake, medication, and/or surgery. Affected individuals may or may not have a prior history of NICCD or FTTDCD.

Management Treatment of manifestations: NICCD: Supplement diet with fat-soluble vitamins and use of lactose-free and medium-chain triglyceride (MCT)-enriched formula. FTTDCD: In addition to dietary treatment, administration of sodium pyruvate may improve growth. CTLN2: Liver transplantation prevents hyperammonemic crises, corrects metabolic disturbances, and eliminates preferences for protein-rich foods; arginine administration decreases blood ammonia concentration and reduced calorie/carbohydrate intake; increased protein intake lessens hypertriglyceridemia. Use of arginine, sodium pyruvate, and MCT oil may delay the need for liver transplantation. Prevention of primary manifestations: Lipid and protein-rich low-carbohydrate diet.

Coffin-Lowry syndrome (CLS) classically manifests in males with developmental delay, intellectual disability, neurologic manifestations (hypotonia, stimulus-induced drop attacks, spastic paraparesis, and seizures), musculoskeletal manifestations (kyphoscoliosis and pectus deformity), and characteristic craniofacial and hand findings. Dental issues, sensorineural hearing loss, and obstructive sleep apnea also occur. The milder end of the continuum in males includes neurodevelopmental disabilities with or without less pronounced multisystem involvement. Heterozygous females often exhibit clinical manifestations that can be consistent with clinically defined CLS but are typically less severe than those seen in affected males. Developmental delay and intellectual disability comprise the core phenotypic findings, and quality of life and prognosis are variably affected by the presence and severity of neurologic and musculoskeletal involvement. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of RPS6KA3-related intellectual disability (RPS6KA3-ID) is established in a male proband with suggestive findings and a hemizygous pathogenic variant in RPS6KA3 identified by molecular genetic testing.

Organ systems outside of the gastrointestinal tract may also be affected (often due to malnutrition and deficiencies of fat-soluble vitamins), including neuromuscular abnormalities (typically in the first or second decade of life) secondary to vitamin E deficiency, poor bone mineralization and delayed bone maturation due to vitamin D deficiency, prolonged international normalized ratio (INR) due to vitamin K deficiency, mild ophthalmologic issues (e.g., micronystagmus, delayed dark adaptation, abnormal visual evoked potentials, and abnormal scotopic electroretinograms), and (in a small proportion of adults) cardiomyopathy with decreased ejection fraction. Affected individuals typically have marked hypocholesterolemia, low plasma apolipoprotein B levels, normal-to-low plasma triglyceride levels, and low serum concentrations of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K). Endoscopy typically demonstrates a gele blanche (\\\"white hoar frosting\\\") appearance of the duodenal mucosa. Diagnosis/testing The molecular diagnosis of CMRD is established in a proband with suggestive findings and biallelic pathogenic variants in SAR1B identified by molecular genetic testing.

Pregnancy management: Vitamin A excess can be harmful to the developing fetus. Therefore, women who are pregnant or who are planning to become pregnant should reduce their vitamin A supplement dose by 50%. Additionally, close monitoring of serum vitamin A levels throughout pregnancy is recommended. Genetic counseling CMRD is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. If both parents are known to be heterozygous for a SAR1B pathogenic variant, each sib of an affected individual has at conception a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of inheriting neither of the familial pathogenic variants.

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics GDAP1-related hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy (GDAP1-HMSN) is a peripheral neuropathy (also known as a subtype of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease) that typically affects the lower extremities earlier and more severely than the upper extremities. As the neuropathy progresses, the distal upper extremities also become severely affected. Proximal muscles can also become weak. Age at onset ranges from infancy to early childhood. In most cases, disease progression causes disabilities within the first or second decade of life. At the end of the second decade, most individuals are wheelchair bound. Disease progression varies considerably even within the same family. The neuropathy can be either of the demyelinating type with reduced nerve conduction velocities or the axonal type with normal nerve conduction velocities. Vocal cord paresis is common. Intelligence is normal. Life expectancy is usually normal, but on occasion may be reduced because of secondary complications. Diagnosis/testing Diagnosis of GDAP1-HMSN is based on clinical findings and confirmed by detection on molecular genetic testing of either biallelic pathogenic variants in GDAP1 in those with autosomal recessive inheritance or a heterozygous pathogenic variant in those with autosomal dominant inheritance. Management Treatment of manifestations: Treatment is symptomatic and involves evaluation and management by a multidisciplinary team that includes neurologists, physiatrists, orthopedic surgeons, and physical and occupational therapists. Treatment may include: daily heel cord stretching exercises to prevent Achilles tendon shortening, ankle/foot orthoses, orthopedic surgery, forearm crutches or canes, wheelchairs, treatment of musculoskeletal pain with acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, and career and employment counseling.

MFN2-HMSN is characterized by more severe involvement of the lower extremities than the upper extremities, distal upper-extremity involvement as the neuropathy progresses, more prominent motor deficits than sensory deficits, and normal (>42 m/s) or only slightly decreased nerve conduction velocities (NCVs). Postural tremor is common. Median onset is age 12 years in the AD form and age eight years in the AR form. The prevalence of optic atrophy is approximately 7% in the AD form and approximately 20% in the AR form. Diagnosis/testing Molecular genetic testing establishes the diagnosis of MFN2-HMSN in 90% of probands with suggestive findings by identifying a heterozygous MFN2 pathogenic variant and in 10% of probands with suggestive findings by identifying biallelic MFN2 pathogenic variants.

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics The autosomal dominant TRPV4 disorders (previously considered to be clinically distinct phenotypes before their molecular basis was discovered) are now grouped into neuromuscular disorders and skeletal dysplasias; however, the overlap within each group is considerable. Affected individuals typically have either neuromuscular or skeletal manifestations alone, and in only rare instances an overlap syndrome has been reported. The three autosomal dominant neuromuscular disorders (mildest to most severe) are: Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2C Scapuloperoneal spinal muscular atrophy Congenital distal spinal muscular atrophy The autosomal dominant neuromuscular disorders are characterized by a congenital-onset, static, or later-onset progressive peripheral neuropathy with variable combinations of laryngeal dysfunction (i.e., vocal fold paresis), respiratory dysfunction, and joint contractures. The six autosomal dominant skeletal dysplasias (mildest to most severe) are: Familial digital arthropathy-brachydactyly Autosomal dominant brachyolmia Spondylometaphyseal dysplasia, Kozlowski type Spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia, Maroteaux type Parastremmatic dysplasia Metatropic dysplasia Author Affiliations: 1 Department of Neurology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland; Email: bmccray3@jhmi.edu; Email: csumner1@jhmi.edu. 2 National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, Neurogenetics Branch, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland; Email: schindlerab@mail.nih.gov. 3 Department of Genetic Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland; Email: jhoover2@jhmi.edu. Copyright 1993-2024, University of Washington, Seattle. GeneReviews is a registered trademark of the University of Washington, Seattle. All rights reserved. GeneReviews The skeletal dysplasia is characterized by brachydactyly (in all 6); the five that are more severe have short stature that varies from mild to severe with progressive spinal deformity and involvement of the long bones and pelvis. In the mildest of the autosomal dominant TRPV4 disorders life span is normal; in the most severe it is shortened. Bilateral progressive sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) can occur with both autosomal dominant neuromuscular disorders and skeletal dysplasias. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of an autosomal dominant TRPV4 disorder is established in a proband with characteristic clinical and neurophysiologic findings, radiographic findings in the skeletal dysplasias, and a heterozygous TRPV4 pathogenic variant identified on molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Treatment is focused on symptom management. Affected individuals are often evaluated and managed by a multidisciplinary team that may include neurologists, physiatrists, orthopedic surgeons, and physical and occupational therapists. SNHL is managed by specialists to determine the best management options. For neuromuscular disorders, neuropathy and respiratory dysfunction are managed in a routine manner; individuals with laryngeal dysfunction require ENT evaluation that should include speech therapy, laryngoscopy, and, in some instances, surgery. For skeletal dysplasias, physical therapy/exercise and heel-cord stretching to maintain function; surgical intervention when kyphoscoliosis compromises pulmonary function and/or causes pain and/or when upper cervical spine instability and/or cervical myelopathy are present. Surveillance: For neuromuscular disorders, annual neurologic examinations, physical therapy assessments, ENT monitoring of laryngeal function, dynamic breathing chest x-ray, and hearing assessment. For skeletal dysplasias, annual evaluation for joint pain and scoliosis; assessment for odontoid hypoplasia before a child reaches school age and before surgical procedures involving general anesthesia; annual hearing assessment. Agents/circumstances to avoid: For neuromuscular disorders, obesity, as it makes walking more difficult; diabetes; medications that are toxic or potentially toxic to persons with a peripheral neuropathy. For skeletal dysplasias, extreme neck flexion and extension (in those with odontoid hypoplasia); activities that place undue stress on the spine and weight-bearing joints. Pregnancy management: Ideally a woman with TRPV4 disorder would seek consultation from a high-risk OB- GYN or maternal-fetal medicine specialist to evaluate risk associated with pregnancy and delivery. Genetic counseling TRPV4 disorders are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Most individuals diagnosed with an autosomal dominant TRPV4 disorder have an affected parent. However, since the most severe skeletal phenotypes can be lethal in childhood (or in utero), children with these phenotypes likely have a de novo pathogenic variant and unaffected parents. Each child of an individual with an autosomal dominant TRPV4 disorder has a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant. Specific phenotype, age of onset, and disease severity cannot be predicted accurately because of reduced penetrance and variable expressivity. However, in general, a child who inherits a TRPV4 pathogenic variant associated with neuromuscular disease or skeletal dysplasia from an affected parent is likely to have the same phenotype as the parent. Prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing are possible if the pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member. Dominant TRPV4 Disorders 3"

GARS1-iSMA. Age of onset ranges from the neonatal period to the toddler years. Initial manifestations are typically respiratory distress, poor feeding, and muscle weakness (distal greater than proximal). Weakness is slowly progressive, ultimately requiring mechanical ventilation and feeding via gastrostomy tube. GARS1-HMSN. Age of onset is most commonly during the second decade (range eight to 36 years). Initial manifestations are typically muscle weakness in the hands sometimes with sensory deficits. Lower limb involvement (seen in ~50% of individuals) ranges from weakness and atrophy of the extensor digitorum brevis and weakness of toe dorsiflexors to classic peroneal muscular atrophy with foot drop and a high steppage gait.

A multidisciplinary team to include a neurologist, pulmonologist, physiatrist, and medical geneticist is recommended. GARS1-HMSN. Symptomatic treatment includes facilitating activities of daily living and addressing of mobility needs by a multidisciplinary team that includes neurologists, physiatrists, orthopedic surgeons, and physical and occupational therapists. Surveillance: GARS1-iSMA. Routine monitoring of: growth, nutritional status, safety of oral feeding vs gastric tube feeding, respiratory status, need for assistive devices for activities of daily living and mobility, developmental progress and educational needs, and family need for social work support. GARS1-HMSN. Routine monitoring of neurologic findings, physical therapy and occupational therapy needs, and skin for pressure ulcers or sores and skin breakdown (particularly the feet, hips, and other pressure points). Agents/circumstances to avoid: Medications that are toxic or potentially toxic to persons with HMSN. Evaluation of relatives at risk: It is appropriate to clarify the genetic status of apparently asymptomatic older and younger at-risk relatives of an individual with GARS1-HMSN in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from prompt initiation of symptomatic management and awareness of agents/circumstances to avoid. Genetic counseling GARS1-associated axonal neuropathy is an autosomal dominant disorder. GARS1-iSMA. All probands reported to date with the GARS1-iSMA phenotype whose parents have undergone molecular genetic testing have the disorder as a result of a de novo GARS1 pathogenic variant. If the GARS1 pathogenic variant cannot be detected in the leukocyte DNA of either parent, the recurrence risk to sibs is estimated to be 1% because of the theoretic possibility of parental germline mosaicism.

Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of SH3TC2-HMSN is established in a proband with suggestive findings and biallelic pathogenic variants in SH3TC2 identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Treatment is symptomatic. Affected individuals are often managed by a multidisciplinary team that includes neurologists, physiatrists, orthopedic surgeons, physical and occupational therapists, audiologists/otolaryngologists, speech and language therapists, and pulmonologists. Surveillance: Routine follow up of motor and sensory manifestations, foot care, spine deformities, occupational and physical therapy needs, hearing, speech, and language therapy needs, and nutrition and growth. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Obesity, which makes walking more difficult; medications that are toxic or potentially toxic to persons with hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy.

GeneReviews Evaluation of relatives at risk: It is appropriate to clarify the genetic status of apparently asymptomatic older and younger sibs of an affected individual in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from early detection and treatment of scoliosis as well as awareness of agents/circumstances to avoid. Genetic counseling SH3TC2-HMSN is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. If both parents are known to be heterozygous for an SH3TC2 pathogenic variant, each sib of an affected individual has at conception a 25% chance of inheriting biallelic SH3TC2 pathogenic variants and being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Because the carrier frequency for SH3TC2-HMSN in certain populations (e.g., individuals of Spanish Roma heritage) is relatively high and the onset of SH3TC2-HMSN may be late, some individuals who undergo carrier testing may be identified as being homozygous. Once the SH3TC2 pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member, carrier testing for at-risk relatives, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk, and preimplantation genetic testing for SH3TC2-HMSN are possible."

Individuals with isolated CMTC have no other syndromic features, and skin lesions tend to fade or resolve. Those with classic CMTC may have accompanying hemihypoplasia with body asymmetry, skin atrophy or ulceration, other vascular malformations, and occasional ocular issues (early-onset glaucoma and/or peripheral retinal vascular attenuation) but do not have other malformations, dysmorphic features, or cognitive impairment. The most common location for the CMTC lesions is on the legs. An affected limb may also display weakness or be unusually susceptible to cold compared to an unaffected limb. In more than half of affected individuals, skin lesions will generally fade across a wide range in age (6 weeks to 26 years), most commonly in the first year of life, but may not resolve completely. Diagnosis/testing A molecular diagnosis can be established in a proband with suggestive cutaneous findings if a mosaic heterozygous pathogenic variant in GNA11 is identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of medical manifestations: Most cutaneous changes improve or resolve with time and do not require intervention. Serial exams with photography are helpful. Persistent CMTC vascular lesions may be addressed with frequency-doubled Nd:YAG, Q-switched alexandrite, and pulsed dye laser therapy, although outcomes are mixed depending on the severity and depth of the lesions.

Shoe lifts or orthotics may be considered in those with mild leg length discrepancies, and epiphysiodesis or limb lengthening may be considered in severe cases. Weakness is typically addressed through physical therapy. Standard treatment per ophthalmologist for glaucoma and peripheral retinal vascular abnormalities is recommended. Treatment of psychosocial issues: Parents should be counseled on how to deal with child abuse accusations that may occur when individuals (including care providers and strangers) who are not familiar with CMTC happen to see their child's skin lesions. Self-esteem issues can be a major problem for affected individuals and may be addressed proactively through resiliency training and bibliotherapy. People unfamiliar with the condition are often worried that the condition may be contagious, so providing this information up front can defuse unwanted curiosity. Surveillance: Close monitoring of the skin for early signs of impending ulceration as determined at initial evaluation; assessment for pain, weakness, and temperature dysregulation at each visit; annual monitoring of limb lengths and girth until skeletal maturity; ophthalmologic evaluation to include measurement of intraocular pressure and consideration of peripheral retinal vascular imaging every six months for the first four years of life, then annually (throughout lifetime) or any time there is ocular pain or visible corneal clouding; annual monitoring of coping skills related to visible physical differences starting at school age.

Most affected individuals represent simplex cases. Vertical transmission of a GNA11 pathogenic variant has not been reported to date. The risk to sibs of a proband with somatic mosaicism for a pathogenic variant in GNA11 would be expected to be the same as in the general population. Rarely, autosomal dominant inheritance has been reported in families with a clinical diagnosis of isolated or classic CMTC (i.e., families in which a GNA11 pathogenic variant has not been identified). Sib recurrence in families with a clinical diagnosis of isolated or classic CMTC has been described but is very rare. Because vertical transmission of a mosaic GNA11 pathogenic variant has not been reported to date and clinically diagnosed isolated and classic CMTC is usually not inherited, risk to family members is presumed to be very low."

CS type I is characterized by normal prenatal growth with the onset of growth and developmental abnormalities in the first two years. By the time the disease has become fully manifest, height, weight, and head circumference are far below the fifth percentile. Progressive impairment of vision, hearing, and central and peripheral nervous system function leads to severe disability; death typically occurs in the first or second decade. CS type II is characterized by growth failure at birth, with little or no postnatal neurologic development. Congenital cataracts or other structural anomalies of the eye may be present. Affected children have early postnatal contractures of the spine (kyphosis, scoliosis) and joints. Death usually occurs by age five years. CS type III is a phenotype in which major clinical features associated with CS only become apparent after age two years; growth and/or cognition exceeds the expectations for CS type I.

On imaging studies, small-vessel brain disease is manifest as diffuse periventricular leukoencephalopathy, lacunar infarcts, microhemorrhage, dilated perivascular spaces, and deep intracerebral hemorrhages. Clinically, small-vessel brain disease manifests as infantile hemiparesis, seizures, single or recurrent hemorrhagic stroke, ischemic stroke, and isolated migraine with aura. Porencephaly (fluid- filled cavities in the brain detected by CT or MRI) is typically manifest as infantile hemiparesis, seizures, and intellectual disability; however, on occasion it can be an incidental finding.

Costello syndrome is typically characterized by failure to thrive in infancy as a result of severe postnatal feeding difficulties; short stature; developmental delay or intellectual disability; coarse facial features (full lips, large mouth, full nasal tip); curly or sparse, fine hair; loose, soft skin with deep palmar and plantar creases; papillomata of the face and perianal region; diffuse hypotonia and joint laxity with ulnar deviation of the wrists and fingers; tight Achilles tendons; and cardiac involvement including cardiac hypertrophy (usually hypertrophic cardiomyopathy), congenital heart defects (usually valvular pulmonic stenosis), and arrhythmia (usually supraventricular tachycardia, especially abnormal atrial rhythm / multifocal atrial tachycardia or ectopic atrial tachycardia). Relative or absolute macrocephaly is typical, and postnatal cerebellar overgrowth can result in the development of a Chiari I malformation with associated anomalies including hydrocephalus or syringomyelia. Individuals with Costello syndrome have an approximately 15% lifetime risk for malignant tumors including rhabdomyosarcoma and neuroblastoma in young children and transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder in adolescents and young adults.

GeneReviews Supportive care: Failure to thrive is the most common and challenging clinical problem; most infants require nasogastric or gastrostomy feeding, and many require Nissen fundoplication. Cardiac manifestations and malignancies are managed through standard protocols. Ulnar deviation of the wrists and fingers often requires early bracing and occupational and/or physical therapy; tight Achilles tendons may require surgical tendon lengthening. Developmental delay requires early intervention programs and individualized education strategies. Recurrent facial papillomata may require removal. General anesthesia may pose a risk to those with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or those predisposed to types of atrial tachycardia. Surveillance: Monitoring for neonatal hypoglycemia; echocardiography with electrocardiogram at the time of diagnosis with subsequent follow up by a cardiologist; abdominal and pelvic ultrasound examinations to screen for rhabdomyosarcoma and neuroblastoma every three to six months until age eight to ten years may be considered; annual urinalysis for evidence of hematuria to screen for bladder cancer beginning at age ten years. Genetic counseling Costello syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder typically caused by a de novo pathogenic variant. Rarely, an individual with Costello syndrome has the disorder as the result of an HRAS pathogenic variant inherited from a heterozygous parent; vertical transmission has been reported in two families with the rare, attenuated phenotype of Costello syndrome. If the HRAS pathogenic variant identified in the proband cannot be detected in the leukocyte DNA of either parent, the recurrence risk to sibs is slightly greater than that of the general population because of the possibility of parental germline mosaicism. Recurrence of Costello syndrome in sibs has been reported and is suspected to be the result of germline mosaicism in a parent. Individuals with classic Costello syndrome typically do not reproduce. If an HRAS pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing are possible."

GeneReviews Evaluation of relatives at risk: If the pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member, molecular genetic testing of at-risk relatives can reduce morbidity and mortality through early diagnosis and treatment; if the pathogenic variants in the family are not known, screening for alterations in acylcarnitines may be of use in identifying other affected family members. Genetic counseling CPT II deficiency is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. At conception, each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being a carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Heterozygotes (carriers) are usually asymptomatic; however, manifesting carriers have been reported. Prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk for one of the severe forms of the disease is possible either by molecular genetic testing of CPT2, if the two pathogenic variants in the family are known, or by assay of CPT II enzyme activity."

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Autosomal dominant craniometaphyseal dysplasia (designated AD-CMD in this review) is characterized by progressive diffuse hyperostosis of cranial bones evident clinically as wide nasal bridge, paranasal bossing, widely spaced eyes with an increase in bizygomatic width, and prominent mandible. Development of dentition may be delayed and teeth may fail to erupt as a result of hyperostosis and sclerosis of alveolar bone. Progressive thickening of craniofacial bones continues throughout life, often resulting in narrowing of the cranial foramina, including the foramen magnum. If untreated, compression of cranial nerves can lead to disabling conditions such as facial palsy, blindness, or deafness (conductive and/or sensorineural hearing loss). In individuals with typical uncomplicated AD-CMD life expectancy is normal; in those with severe AD-CMD life expectancy can be reduced as a result of compression of the foramen magnum. Diagnosis/testing Diagnosis is based on clinical and radiographic findings that include diffuse hyperostosis of the cranial base, cranial vault, facial bones, and mandible as well as widening and radiolucency of metaphyses in long bones. Identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in ANKH by molecular genetic testing can confirm the diagnosis if clinical features are inconclusive. Management Treatment of manifestations: Treatment for feeding and respiratory issues per craniofacial team; surgical intervention to reduce compression of cranial nerves and the brain stem / spinal cord at the level of the foramen magnum. Severely overgrown facial bones can be contoured; however, surgical procedures can be technically difficult and bone regrowth is common. Hearing aids; vision aids and surgical treatment for optic nerve impaction; speech therapy; surgical intervention for malocclusion.

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics The creatine deficiency disorders (CDDs), inborn errors of creatine metabolism and transport, comprise three disorders: the creatine biosynthesis disorders guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT) deficiency and L- arginine:glycine amidinotransferase (AGAT) deficiency; and creatine transporter (CRTR) deficiency. Developmental delay and cognitive dysfunction or intellectual disability and speech-language disorder are common to all three CDDs. Onset of clinical manifestations of GAMT deficiency (reported in ~130 individuals) is between ages three months and two years; in addition to developmental delays, the majority of individuals have epilepsy and develop a behavior disorder (e.g., hyperactivity, autism, or self-injurious behavior), and about 30% have movement disorder. AGAT deficiency has been reported in 16 individuals; none have had epilepsy or movement disorders. Clinical findings of CRTR deficiency in affected males (reported in ~130 individuals) in addition to developmental delays include epilepsy (variable seizure types and may be intractable) and behavior disorders (e.g., attention deficit and/or hyperactivity, autistic features, impulsivity, social anxiety), hypotonia, and (less commonly) a movement disorder. Poor weight gain with constipation and prolonged QTc on EKG have been reported. While mild-to-moderate intellectual disability is commonly observed up to age four years, the majority of adult males with CRTR deficiency have been reported to have severe intellectual disability. Females heterozygous for CRTR deficiency are typically either asymptomatic or have mild intellectual disability, although a more severe phenotype resembling the male phenotype has been reported.

Diagnosis/testing GeneReviews The diagnosis of a CDD is established in a proband with suggestive findings and biallelic pathogenic variants in GAMT or GATM or a hemizygous or heterozygous pathogenic variant in SLC6A8 identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: GAMT deficiency and AGAT deficiency are treated with oral creatine monohydrate to replenish cerebral creatine levels. Treatment of GAMT deficiency requires supplementation of ornithine and dietary restriction of arginine or protein. CRTR deficiency is treated with oral creatine monohydrate and arginine and glycine supplementation. The developmental delay, intellectual disability, and behavior problems are managed with an individualized education and therapy program; epilepsy and movement disorder are treated by the appropriate specialist in a standard manner. Surveillance: In those treated with creatine monohydrate, periodic determination of cerebral creatine level by in vivo 1H-MRS and annual measurement of renal function to detect possible creatine-associated nephropathy is warranted. Developmental and neurologic assessments are recommended at each clinic visit. Evaluation of relatives at risk: Early diagnosis of neonates at risk for a CDD by biochemical or molecular genetic testing allows for early diagnosis and treatment. Genetic counseling GAMT deficiency (caused by pathogenic variants in GAMT) and AGAT deficiency (caused by pathogenic variants in GATM) are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. CRTR deficiency (caused by pathogenic variants in SLC6A8) is inherited in an X-linked manner. Autosomal recessive inheritance. If both parents are known to be heterozygous for a GAMT or GATM pathogenic variant, each sib of an affected individual has at conception a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Once the GAMT or GATM pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member, molecular genetic carrier testing and prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Citrullinemia type I (CTLN1) presents as a spectrum that includes a neonatal acute form (the \\\"classic\\\" form), a milder late-onset form (the \\\"non-classic\\\" form), a form in which women have onset of symptoms at pregnancy or post partum, and a form without symptoms or hyperammonemia. Distinction between the forms is based primarily on clinical findings, although emerging evidence suggests that measurement of residual argininosuccinate synthase enzyme activity may help to predict those who are likely to have a severe phenotype and those who are likely to have an attenuated phenotype. Infants with the acute neonatal form appear normal at birth. Shortly thereafter, they develop hyperammonemia and become progressively lethargic, feed poorly, often vomit, and may develop signs of increased intracranial pressure (ICP). Without prompt intervention, hyperammonemia and the accumulation of other toxic metabolites (e.g., glutamine) result in increased ICP, increased neuromuscular tone, spasticity, ankle clonus, seizures, loss of consciousness, and death. Children with the severe form who are treated promptly may survive for an indeterminate period of time, but usually with significant neurologic deficits. Even with chronic protein restriction and scavenger therapy, long-term complications such as liver failure and other (rarely reported) organ system manifestations are possible. The late-onset form may be milder than that seen in the acute neonatal form, but commences later in life for reasons that are not completely understood. The episodes of hyperammonemia are similar to those seen in the acute neonatal form, but the initial neurologic findings may be more subtle because of the older age of the affected individuals. Women with onset of severe symptoms including acute hepatic decompensation during pregnancy or in the postpartum period have been reported. Furthermore, previously asymptomatic and non- pregnant individuals have been described who remained asymptomatic up to at least age ten years, with the possibility that they could remain asymptomatic lifelong.

Diagnosis/testing GeneReviews The diagnosis of CTLN1 is established in a proband with elevated plasma ammonia concentration (>150 mol/L; may range to 2000-3000 mol/L), elevated plasma citrulline concentration (usually >500 mol/L), and absent argininosuccinate and/or by identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in ASS1 on molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Liver transplantation is the only known curative therapy and eliminates the need for dietary restriction. Transplantation is ideally performed in affected individuals who are younger than age one year (prior to the development of any neurocognitive impairment) but older than age three months and/or above 5 kg body weight. Daily routine treatment in those who have not undergone a liver transplantation includes lifelong protein restriction in conjunction with a metabolic nutritionist; nitrogen scavenger medications; arginine supplementation; consideration of carnitine supplementation in those with secondary carnitine deficiency; addressing increased energy/caloric demands through tube feedings (as needed); and routine treatment of developmental delay / intellectual disability. Acute inpatient treatment of a metabolic crisis includes addressing hyperammonemia through withholding of all protein intake for a maximum of 24 to 28 hours; pharmacologic nitrogen scavenger therapy; and consideration of dialysis (the most effective means of reducing plasma ammonia concentration rapidly). To address increased catabolism, administration of high-energy fluids (and insulin, as needed) and intravenous intralipids is typically required. However, care must be taken to avoid electrolyte imbalance and fluid overload, which can contribute to the development of increased intracranial pressure. The patient should be maintained on the dry side of fluid balance (approximately 85 mL/kg of body weight per day in infants and appropriate corresponding fluid restriction in children and adults). Prevention of secondary complications: Education of parents and caregivers such that diligent observation and management can be administered expediently in the setting of intercurrent illness or other catabolic stressors; written protocols for maintenance and emergency treatment should be provided to parents and primary care providers / pediatricians, and to teachers and school staff. For those affected individuals requiring any sedated procedure where a person cannot eat for an extended period of time, drug treatment should be switched to IV and nutrition with 10% glucose with age-appropriate electrolytes should be administered via IV to promote anabolism starting as soon as the patient is NPO. Surveillance: Follow up in a metabolic clinic with a qualified metabolic nutritionist and clinical biochemical geneticist is required. Measurement of growth parameters; evaluation of nutrition status and safety of oral intake; assessment for early warning signs of impending hyperammonemic episodes (mood changes, headache, lethargy, nausea, refusal to eat); review of dietary assessment; monitoring of developmental progress/educational needs; assessment of mobility and self-help skills; and measurement of carnitine levels (for those on sodium benzoate) at each visit. Plasma amino acid analysis at least every three months during the first year of life and every six to 12 months in the teenage/adult years (depending on clinical stability). Agents/circumstances to avoid: Excessive protein intake, prolonged fasting, and obvious exposure to communicable diseases. Evaluation of relatives at risk: It is important that at-risk sibs be identified as soon as possible, either through molecular genetic testing (if the pathogenic variants in the family are known) or measurement of plasma concentrations of ammonia and citrulline on the first day of life. Elevation of either above acceptable levels Type I 3 (ammonia >100 mol/L or plasma citrulline >~100 mol/L) is sufficient evidence to initiate treatment in a newborn. Pregnancy management: Because women with onset of severe symptoms during pregnancy or in the postpartum period have been reported, scrupulous attention needs to be paid to diet and medication during these periods. Genetic counseling CTLN1 is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. At conception, each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier.

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Cystinosis comprises three allelic phenotypes: Nephropathic cystinosis in untreated children is characterized by renal Fanconi syndrome, poor growth, hypophosphatemic/calcipenic rickets, impaired glomerular function resulting in complete glomerular failure, and accumulation of cystine in almost all cells, leading to cellular dysfunction with tissue and organ impairment. The typical untreated child has short stature, rickets, and photophobia. Failure to thrive is generally noticed after approximately age six months; signs of renal tubular Fanconi syndrome (polyuria, polydipsia, dehydration, and acidosis) appear as early as age six months; corneal crystals can be present before age one year and are always present after age 16 months. Prior to the use of renal transplantation and cystine-depleting therapy, the life span in nephropathic cystinosis was no longer than ten years. With these interventions, affected individuals can survive at least into the mid-forties or fifties with satisfactory quality of life. Intermediate cystinosis is characterized by all the typical manifestations of nephropathic cystinosis, but onset is at a later age. Renal glomerular failure occurs in all untreated affected individuals, usually between ages 15 and 25 years. The non-nephropathic (ocular) form of cystinosis is characterized clinically only by photophobia resulting from corneal cystine crystal accumulation. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of cystinosis is established in a proband by one of the following: Identification of cystine crystals in the cornea on slit lamp examination Identification of elevated cystine concentration in polymorphonuclear leukocytes Demonstration of increased cystine content in cultured fibroblasts or in the placenta at the time of birth Identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in CTNS on molecular genetic testing Author Affiliations: 1 Clinical Center National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland; Email: nesterovag@mail.nih.gov. 2 Clinical Director, National Human Genome Research Institute National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland; Email: bgahl@helix.nih.gov. Copyright 1993-2024, University of Washington, Seattle. GeneReviews is a registered trademark of the University of Washington, Seattle. All rights reserved. Management GeneReviews Treatment of manifestations: Renal Fanconi syndrome is treated by replacement of tubular losses of electrolytes, bicarbonate, minerals, and other small molecular weight nutrients; children should have free access to water and bathroom privileges and supplementation with citrate to alkalinize the blood; phosphate replacement and vitamin D supplements are also used to prevent and treat rickets; skeletal deformities should be addressed early with the help of orthopedic specialists. Fluid and nutrient replacement is required during episodes of dehydration. For renal glomerular disease, oral cysteamine reduces cellular cystine; renal transplantation provides the ultimate treatment. Cysteamine eye drops relieve photophobia. Nutrition must be adequate to minimize failure to thrive in infants. Growth hormone replacement, L-thyroxine for hypothyroidism, insulin for diabetes mellitus, and testosterone for hypogonadism in males are all beneficial. Physical and speech therapy is helpful for the muscle deterioration and swallowing difficulties of older individuals. Prevention of primary manifestations: Therapy with cystine-depleting agents begun as soon as the diagnosis is made or (if possible) shortly after birth will significantly slow the progression of glomerular damage; renal damage present at the time of diagnosis is irreversible. With optimal symptomatic and cystine-depleting therapy affected individuals grow at a normal rate but generally do not recover lost height unless human growth hormone is administered. Prevention of secondary complications: Those who have undergone renal transplantation should be monitored for signs of immunodeficiency and infection; carnitine supplementation administered pre-transplant may improve muscle strength; treatment with proton pump inhibitors helps relieve cysteamine-induced gastric acid hypersecretion. Surveillance: Evaluation by a nephrologist every three to six months depending on the severity of renal impairment; ophthalmologic evaluation every one to two years; assessment of bone mineralization throughout the disease course; fasting blood glucose concentration and testosterone concentration every two to three years (in males, starting before puberty); monitoring for late-onset complications by a multidisciplinary medical team. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Dehydration; sun exposure if photophobia is present. Evaluation of relatives at risk: Biochemical and/or molecular genetic testing (if the genetic status of the proband is known) allows for early diagnosis and treatment. Genetic counseling Cystinosis is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. At conception, each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Carrier testing for at-risk relatives and prenatal diagnosis for pregnancies at increased risk are possible if both pathogenic variants have been identified in the family. For pregnancies at increased risk for nephropathic cystinosis, prenatal diagnosis is also possible biochemically, based on elevated cystine concentrations in both chorionic villi and amniocytes."

Chronic diarrhea from infancy and/or neonatal cholestasis may be the earliest clinical manifestation. In approximately 75% of affected individuals, cataracts are the first finding, often appearing in the first decade of life. Xanthomas appear in the second or third decade; they occur on the Achilles tendon, the extensor tendons of the elbow and hand, the patellar tendon, and the neck tendons. Xanthomas have been reported in the lung, bones, and central nervous system. Some individuals show cognitive impairment from early infancy, whereas the majority have normal or only slightly impaired intellectual function until puberty; dementia with slow deterioration in intellectual abilities occurs in the third decade in more than 50% of individuals. Neuropsychiatric symptoms such as behavioral changes, hallucinations, agitation, aggression, depression, and suicide attempts may be prominent. Pyramidal signs (i.e., spasticity) and/or cerebellar signs almost invariably become evident between ages 20 and 30 years. The biochemical abnormalities that distinguish CTX from other conditions with xanthomas include high plasma and tissue cholestanol concentration, normal-to-low plasma cholesterol concentration, decreased chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), increased concentration of bile alcohols and their glyconjugates, and increased concentrations of cholestanol and apolipoprotein B in cerebrospinal fluid. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of CTX is established in a proband with suggestive findings and biallelic pathogenic variants in CYP27A1 identified on molecular genetic testing.

Management GeneReviews Treatment of manifestations: Long-term treatment with CDCA normalizes plasma and CSF concentration of cholestanol and improves neurophysiologic findings. Inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase alone or in combination with CDCA are also effective in decreasing cholestanol concentration and improving clinical signs; however, they may induce muscle damage. Cholic acid treatment decreases cholestanol levels and improves neurologic symptoms in the few individuals in whom it has been tried and may be useful in those who experience side effects with CDCA treatments. Cataract extraction is typically required in at least one eye by age 50 years. Epilepsy, spasticity, and parkinsonism are treated symptomatically. Prevention of primary manifestations: Early treatment with CDCA in presymptomatic individuals appears to prevent clinical manifestations. Surveillance: Annual cholestanol plasma concentration, neurologic and neuropsychological evaluation, brain MRI, echocardiogram, and assessment of bone density. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Caution has been suggested with statins. Evaluation of relatives at risk: It is appropriate to clarify the genetic status of apparently asymptomatic older and younger at-risk relatives of an affected individual in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from prompt initiation of CDCA treatment and surveillance. Pregnancy management: Treatment with CDCA should not be interrupted during pregnancy. Genetic counseling CTX is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. If both parents are known to be heterozygous for a CYP27A1 pathogenic variant, each sib of an affected individual has at conception a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being a carrier, and a 25% chance of inheriting neither of the familial pathogenic variants. Carrier testing for at-risk family members and prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing are possible if both CYP27A1 pathogenic variants in the family are known."

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is characterized by episodic syncope occurring during exercise or acute emotion. The underlying cause of these episodes is the onset of fast ventricular tachycardia (bidirectional or polymorphic). Spontaneous recovery may occur when these arrhythmias self- terminate. In other instances, ventricular tachycardia may degenerate into ventricular fibrillation and cause sudden death if cardiopulmonary resuscitation is not readily available. The mean onset of symptoms (usually a syncopal episode) is between age seven and 12 years; onset as late as the fourth decade of life has been reported. If untreated, CPVT is highly lethal, as approximately 30% of affected individuals experience at least one cardiac arrest and up to 80% have one or more syncopal spells. Sudden death may be the first manifestation of the disease. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of CPVT is established in the presence of a structurally normal heart, normal resting EKG, and exercise- or emotion-induced bidirectional or polymorphic ventricular tachycardia OR in individuals who have a heterozygous pathogenic variant in RYR2, CALM1, CALM2, CALM3, CASQ2, or KCNJ2 or biallelic pathogenic variants in CASQ2, TECRL, or TRDN.

Management GeneReviews Treatment of manifestations: Recent studies have demonstrated that (1) nadolol is the most effective beta blocker in CPVT; (2) nonselective beta blockers (nadolol and propranolol) are superior to selective beta blockers; (3) a significant burden of life-threatening arrhythmias persists after left cardiac sympathetic denervation; (4) an implantable cardioverter defibrillator is effective for those individuals in whom arrhythmias are not adequately controlled by drug therapy. Prevention of primary manifestations: Beta blockers are indicated for all clinically affected individuals, and for individuals with a pathogenic variant(s) in one of the genes associated with CPVT with a negative exercise stress test, since sudden death can be the first manifestation of the disease. Flecainide can be added for primary prevention of a cardiac arrest when beta blockers alone cannot control the onset of arrhythmias during an exercise stress test. Surveillance: Follow-up visits with a cardiologist every six to 12 months (depending on disease severity) are very important, especially until puberty, since body weight increases rapidly and drug dosages must be continually adjusted. Limitation on physical activity can be defined on the basis of an exercise stress test done in the hospital setting; the use of commercially available heart rate-monitoring devices for sports participation can be helpful in keeping the heart rate in a safe range during physical activity, but should not be considered as an alternative to medical follow-up visits; allowed exercise intensity should be individualized based on exercise stress test results. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Competitive sports and other strenuous exercise; use of digitalis. Evaluation of relatives at risk: Because treatment and surveillance are available to reduce morbidity and mortality, first-degree relatives of a proband should be offered molecular genetic testing if the family-specific pathogenic variant(s) are known; if the family-specific variant(s) are not known, all first-degree relatives of an affected individual should be evaluated with resting EKG, Holter monitoring, echocardiography, and most importantly exercise stress testing. Genetic counseling RYR2-, CALM1-, CALM2-, CALM3-, and KCNJ2-related CPVT are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. CASQ2-related CPVT is typically inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. However, because a subset of individuals (still unquantified but rare) with heterozygous CASQ2 pathogenic variants show a mild CPVT phenotype, autosomal dominant inheritance may not be ruled out for CASQ2-related CPVT, and clinical screening is indicated accordingly in individuals who are heterozygous for a CASQ2 pathogenic variant. TECRL- and TRDN-related CPVT are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Autosomal dominant inheritance. Each child of an individual with autosomal dominant CPVT has a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant. Autosomal recessive inheritance. If both parents are known to be heterozygous for a CASQ2, TECRL, or TRDN pathogenic variant, each sib of an affected individual has at conception a 25% chance of inheriting biallelic pathogenic variants and being affected, a 50% chance of inheriting one pathogenic variant and being heterozygous, and a 25% chance of inheriting neither of the familial pathogenic variants. Heterozygote testing for at-risk relatives requires prior identification of the CASQ2, TECRL, or TRDN pathogenic variants in the family. Once the CPVT-related pathogenic variant(s) have been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.

Infectious complications are generally more severe in congenital neutropenia than in cyclic neutropenia. In congenital neutropenia, omphalitis immediately after birth may be the first sign; in untreated children diarrhea, pneumonia, and deep abscesses in the liver, lungs, and subcutaneous tissues are common in the first year of life. After 15 years with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor treatment, the risk of developing myelodysplasia (MDS) or acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) is approximately 15%-25%. Cyclic neutropenia is usually diagnosed within the first year of life based on approximately three-week intervals of fever and oral ulcerations and regular oscillations of blood cell counts. Cellulitis, especially perianal cellulitis, is common during neutropenic periods. Between neutropenic periods, affected individuals are generally healthy. Symptoms improve in adulthood. Cyclic neutropenia is not associated with risk of malignancy or conversion to leukemia. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of ELANE-related neutropenia is established in a proband with suggestive clinical findings and the identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in ELANE through molecular genetic testing.

GeneReviews lifesaving, when an affected individual has signs of serious infection, which may be caused by both aerobic and anaerobic pathogens. Prevention of primary manifestations: Treatment with G-CSF ameliorates symptoms and reduces infections in almost all affected individuals. Once absolute neutrophil count (ANC) levels normalize, resistance to infection greatly improves, such that affected individuals should be able to attend school, work, and recreational activities without specific concern. For affected individuals with a well-matched donor, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) may be the preferred treatment option. HSCT is the only alternative therapy for individuals with congenital neutropenia who are refractory to high-dose G-CSF or who undergo malignant transformation. Prevention of secondary complications: Good dental hygiene; routine immunizations. Surveillance: Those with congenital neutropenia not undergoing HSCT require surveillance for malignant transformation to MDS/AML. Agents/circumstances to avoid: There is no need to avoid public places, as most infections are as a result of common organisms that occur on body surfaces. Pregnancy management: Pregnancies in women with severe chronic neutropenia are at substantial risk for miscarriage; treatment with G-CSF may reduce this risk. Evaluation of relatives at risk: Evaluate sibs and other at-risk relatives by molecular genetic testing for the ELANE pathogenic variant found in the proband to identify those with previously unrecognized mild or moderately severe disease who may benefit from treatment. Serial ANCs can also be used for evaluation of family members. Genetic counseling ELANE-related neutropenia is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. One parent of a proband is usually affected.

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics CYLD cutaneous syndrome (CCS) typically manifests in the second or third decade with the appearance of multiple skin tumors including cylindromas, spiradenomas, trichoepitheliomas, and rarely, membranous basal cell adenoma of the salivary gland. The first tumor typically develops at puberty and tumors progressively accumulate through adulthood. Females often have more tumors than males. Tumors typically arise on the scalp and face but can also arise on the torso and sun-protected sites, such as the genital and axillary skin. A minority of individuals develop salivary gland tumors. Rarely, pulmonary cylindromas can develop in large airways and compromise breathing. Although the tumors are usually benign, malignant transformation is recognized. Diagnosis / testing The diagnosis of CYLD cutaneous syndrome is established in a proband with multiple skin tumors (histologically confirmed cylindromas, spiradenomas, and/or trichoepitheliomas) and/or by identification of a germline heterozygous pathogenic variant in CYLD by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Removal of cylindromas, spiradenomas, and trichoepitheliomas is by conventional surgery. Ideally, as much normal scalp and skin should be preserved. \\\"Scalp-sparing\\\" strategies include early primary excision with direct skin closure, tumor enucleation followed by direct skin closure, and excision followed by secondary intention healing techniques. Hyfrecation or laser ablation of selected small tumors may be considered. Mohs micrographic surgery for recurrence of tumors after failure of primary surgical excision may have limited benefit. Multidisciplinary team management of tumors that have undergone malignant transformation is recommended.

Genetic counseling Germline pathogenic variants in CYLD are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Most individuals with CYLD cutaneous syndrome inherit it from a parent. The degree of severity can vary within families; for example, a mildly affected parent may have a more severely affected child or vice versa. Offspring of an individual with CYLD cutaneous syndrome have a 50% chance of inheriting the variant. Prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk is possible if the CYLD pathogenic variant in the family is known; however, requests for prenatal testing for later-onset diseases are uncommon and require careful genetic counseling."

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Danon disease is a multisystem condition with predominant involvement of the heart, skeletal muscles, and retina, with overlying cognitive dysfunction. Males are typically more severely affected than females. Males usually present with childhood onset concentric hypertrophic cardiomyopathy that is progressive and often requires heart transplantation. Rarely, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy can evolve to resemble dilated cardiomyopathy. Most affected males also have cardiac conduction abnormalities. Skeletal muscle weakness may lead to delayed acquisition of motor milestones. Learning disability and intellectual disability, most often in the mild range, are common. Additionally, affected males can develop retinopathy with subsequent visual impairment. The clinical features in females are broader and more variable. Females are more likely to have dilated cardiomyopathy, with a smaller proportion requiring heart transplantation compared to affected males. Cardiac conduction abnormalities, skeletal muscle weakness, mild cognitive impairment, and pigmentary retinopathy are variably seen in affected females. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of Danon disease is established in a proband (male or female) with suggestive findings and/or a hemizygous (in males) or a heterozygous (in females) pathogenic variant in LAMP2 identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: While the age of onset and progression of disease are typically later and slower in females, the management approach in males and females is similar.

Although DBH deficiency is present from birth, the diagnosis is often not generally recognized until late childhood. In the perinatal period, DBH deficiency has been complicated by vomiting, dehydration, hypotension, hypothermia, and hypoglycemia requiring repeated hospitalization, and the diagnosis may be identified fortuitously in the neonatal period with investigation of hypoglycemia. Children may report reduced exercise capacity. By early adulthood, individuals have profound orthostatic hypotension, greatly reduced exercise tolerance, ptosis, and nasal stuffiness. Presyncopal symptoms include dizziness, blurred vision, dyspnea, nuchal discomfort, and chest pain; symptoms may worsen in hot environments or after heavy meals or alcohol ingestion. Some individuals have abnormal kidney function, joint laxity, hypotonia, high-arched palate, anemia, and/or hypoglycemia. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of DBH deficiency is established in a proband with profound neurogenic orthostatic hypotension, minimal or absent plasma concentrations of norepinephrine and epinephrine, a five- to tenfold elevation of plasma dopamine, and biallelic pathogenic variants in DBH identified by molecular genetic testing.

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics The dystrophinopathies cover a spectrum of X-linked muscle disease ranging from mild to severe that includes Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Becker muscular dystrophy, and DMD-associated dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). The mild end of the spectrum includes the phenotypes of asymptomatic increase in serum concentration of creatine phosphokinase (CK) and muscle cramps with myoglobinuria. The severe end of the spectrum includes progressive muscle diseases that are classified as Duchenne/Becker muscular dystrophy when skeletal muscle is primarily affected and as DMD-associated DCM when the heart is primarily affected. Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) usually presents in early childhood with delayed motor milestones including delays in walking independently and standing up from a supine position. Proximal weakness causes a waddling gait and difficulty climbing stairs, running, jumping, and standing up from a squatting position. DMD is rapidly progressive, with affected children being wheelchair dependent by age 12 years. Cardiomyopathy occurs in almost all individuals with DMD after age 18 years. Few survive beyond the third decade, with respiratory complications and progressive cardiomyopathy being common causes of death. Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) is characterized by later-onset skeletal muscle weakness. With improved diagnostic techniques, it has been recognized that the mild end of the spectrum includes men with onset of symptoms after age 30 years who remain ambulatory even into their 60s. Despite the milder skeletal muscle involvement, heart failure from DCM is a common cause of morbidity and the most common cause of death in BMD. Mean age of death is in the mid-40s. DMD-associated DCM is characterized by left ventricular dilatation and congestive heart failure. Females heterozygous for a DMD pathogenic variant are at increased risk for DCM.

Diagnosis/testing GeneReviews The diagnosis of a dystrophinopathy is established in a proband with the characteristic clinical findings and elevated CK concentration and/or by identification of a hemizygous pathogenic variant in DMD on molecular genetic testing in a male and of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in DMD on molecular genetic testing in a female. Females may present with a classic dystrophinopathy or may be asymptomatic carriers. Management Treatment of manifestations: ACE inhibitors are used with or without beta blockers for cardiomyopathy in both DMD and BMD phenotypes. Congestive heart failure is treated with diuretics and oxygen as needed; cardiac transplantation is offered to persons with severe dilated cardiomyopathy and BMD with limited or no clinical evidence of skeletal muscle disease. Scoliosis is treated with bracing and surgery. Corticosteroid therapy improves muscle strength and function for individuals with DMD between ages five and 15 years; the same treatment is used in BMD, although the efficacy is less clear. Dystrophin restoration therapies have been developed by using synthetic antisense oligonucleotides to restore the reading frame by exon skipping for individuals with specific pathogenic variants in DMD. Prevention of secondary complications: Evaluation by a pulmonologist and cardiologist before surgeries; pneumococcal and influenza immunizations annually; nutrition assessment; physical therapy to promote mobility and prevent contractures; sunshine and a balanced diet rich in vitamin D and calcium to improve bone density and reduce the risk of fractures; weight control to avoid obesity. Surveillance: For males with DMD or BMD: annual or biannual evaluation by a cardiologist beginning at the time of diagnosis; monitoring for scoliosis; baseline pulmonary function testing before wheelchair dependence; frequent evaluations by a pediatric pulmonologist. For heterozygous females: cardiac evaluation at least once after the teenage years. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Botulinum toxin injections; succinylcholine and inhalational anesthetics because of susceptibility to malignant hyperthermia or malignant hyperthermia-like reactions. Evaluation of relatives at risk: Early identification of heterozygous females who are at increased risk for cardiomyopathy and, thus, need routine cardiac surveillance and prompt treatment. Genetic counseling The dystrophinopathies are inherited in an X-linked manner. The risk to the sibs of a proband depends on the genetic status of the mother. Heterozygous females have a 50% chance of transmitting the DMD pathogenic variant in each pregnancy. Sons who inherit the pathogenic variant will be affected; daughters who inherit the pathogenic variant are heterozygous and may have a range of clinical manifestations. Males with DMD usually do not reproduce. Males with BMD or DMD-associated DCM may reproduce: all of their daughters are heterozygotes; none of their sons inherit their father's DMD pathogenic variant. Carrier testing for at-risk females, prenatal testing, and preimplantation genetic testing are possible if the DMD pathogenic variant in the family is known. 3"

LMNA-related DCM usually presents in early to mid-adulthood with symptomatic conduction system disease or arrhythmias, or with symptomatic DCM including heart failure or embolus from a left ventricular mural thrombus. Sudden cardiac death can occur, and in some instances is the presenting manifestation; sudden cardiac death may occur with minimal or no systolic dysfunction. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of LMNA-related DCM is established in a proband with suggestive findings and a heterozygous pathogenic variant in LMNA identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Chronic atrial fibrillation is treated initially with attempts to restore normal sinus rhythm, anticoagulation, and rate control. Symptomatic supraventricular arrhythmias are usually treated with pharmacologic therapy or ablation; symptomatic bradyarrhythmias or significant heart block is treated with an electronic pacemaker. Symptomatic ventricular arrhythmias, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, and resuscitated sudden cardiac death are treated with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) and drug therapy as needed. Because risk for sudden cardiac death in LMNA-related DCM accompanies heart block and bradyarrhythmias, ICD use (rather than just pacemaker use) has been recommended for all indications. Treatment of symptomatic DCM, including heart failure, is pharmacologic with ACE inhibitors, beta blockers, and other conventional approaches. Progressive deterioration in left ventricular function is treated with an ICD. Cardiac transplantation or other advanced therapies may be considered for refractory disease in persons receiving comprehensive care from cardiovascular disease experts.

GeneReviews Surveillance: Individuals with an LMNA pathogenic variant who are found to have any EKG abnormality should undergo a cardiovascular evaluation for disease progression (EKG, 24-48 hour rhythm monitoring, LV function measurement) at least annually. Asymptomatic individuals with a pathogenic LMNA variant should undergo cardiovascular evaluation (medical history, physical examination, echocardiogram, and EKG) every one to two years and/or whenever new symptoms arise. In families with a known LMNA pathogenic variant, at-risk individuals for whom genetic testing is not possible should have yearly cardiovascular evaluation. At onset of new symptoms an immediate evaluation for evidence of DCM and/or conduction system disease is indicated regardless of genetic status. Evaluation of relatives at risk: To facilitate prompt diagnosis, targeted LMNA genetic testing when the family- specific pathogenic variant is known; otherwise regular surveillance with cardiovascular screening tests. Pregnancy management: Pregnancy is contraindicated in women with DCM. Pregnant women with DCM should be followed by a high-risk obstetrician. At-risk women with unknown genetic status should undergo a cardiovascular evaluation and be offered genetic counseling, ideally prior to pregnancy.

The hearing impairment appears to be consistent in age of onset and progression, whereas the neurologic, visual, and neuropsychiatric signs vary in degree of severity and rate of progression. Females may have mild hearing impairment and focal dystonia. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of DDON syndrome is established in either a male proband who has a hemizygous TIMM8A pathogenic variant (~50% of affected males) or a female proband who has a heterozygous TIMM8A pathogenic variant (~50% of affected females) or a contiguous gene deletion of Xq22.1 involving TIMM8A (~50% of affected males and females). Management Treatment of manifestations: Educational programs for developmental and sensory deficits, including training in tactile sign language. Because auditory neuronopathy is the cause of the hearing loss, hearing aids have only variable success. Physical medicine and rehabilitation, physical and occupational therapy to improve fine and gross motor skills and mobility, to prevent contractures, and to provide adaptive devices to improve activities of daily living. Standard treatment of behavioral issues / psychiatric disorders. Ensure appropriate social work involvement to connect families with local resources, respite, and support, especially care coordination with multiple subspecialty appointments, equipment, medications, and supplies.

Genetic counseling DDON syndrome is inherited in an X-linked manner. If the mother of a proband with DDON syndrome has the causative genetic alteration (i.e., a TIMM8A pathogenic variant or a contiguous gene deletion of Xq22.1 involving TIMM8A), the chance of transmitting the genetic alteration in each pregnancy is 50%. Males who inherit the genetic alteration will be affected; females who inherit the genetic alteration will be heterozygotes and may have mild hearing impairment and focal dystonia.

All affected individuals reported to date have developmental delay / intellectual disability ranging from mild to severe; about 50% of affected girls remain nonverbal after age five years. Hypotonia, a common finding, can be associated with feeding difficulty in infancy. Behavioral issues can include autism spectrum disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and hyperactivity, self-injurious behavior, poor impulse control, and aggression. Other findings can include seizures, movement disorders (dyskinesia, spasticity, abnormal gait), vision and hearing impairment, congenital heart defects, respiratory difficulties, joint laxity, and scoliosis. Neuroblastoma has been observed in three individuals. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of DDX3X-NDD is established in a female proband with suggestive findings and a heterozygous de novo DDX3X pathogenic variant identified by molecular genetic testing and in a male proband with suggestive findings and a hemizygous DDX3X pathogenic variant.

Starting at age eight years, assess girls for evidence of precocious puberty. Genetic counseling DDX3X-NDD is an X-linked disorder. Females. Most female probands represent simplex cases (i.e., a single occurrence in a family) and have the disorder as the result of a de novo pathogenic variant. Males. DDX3X-NDD in males is caused by either a pathogenic variant inherited from an unaffected heterozygous mother or a de novo pathogenic variant. If the mother of an affected male has a DDX3X pathogenic variant, the chance of transmitting it in each pregnancy is 50%. Males who inherit the pathogenic variant will be affected; females who inherit the pathogenic variant will be heterozygotes and are not expected to manifest a neurodevelopmental phenotype. If the proband is female and represents a simplex case and if the DDX3X pathogenic variant cannot be detected in the leukocyte DNA of either parent or the proband is male and the DDX3X pathogenic variant cannot be detected in the leukocyte DNA of the mother the risk to sibs is slightly greater than that of the general population (though still <1%) because of the possibility of parental germline mosaicism. Once the DDX3X pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible."

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics The 16p11.2 recurrent deletion phenotype is characterized by motor speech disorder, language disorder, motor coordination difficulties, psychiatric conditions, and autistic features. While most, if not all, individuals with the 16p11.2 recurrent deletion experience some degree of developmental delay, the severity varies significantly. Most affected individuals do not have intellectual disability (defined as an IQ of <70), but many have below average cognition and learning disabilities in both verbal and nonverbal domains. Obesity is a feature of this disorder and generally emerges in childhood; BMI in individuals with the 16p11.2 recurrent deletion is significantly higher than in the general population by age five years. Seizures are observed in approximately 25% of individuals with the recurrent deletion. Vertebral anomalies, hearing impairment, macrocephaly, and cardiovascular malformation have each been observed in some individuals. Clinical follow-up data from adults suggests that the greatest medical challenges are obesity and related comorbidities that can be exacerbated by medications used to treat behavioral and psychiatric problems. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of 16p11.2 recurrent deletion is established by detection of a heterozygous ~593-kb recurrent deletion at the approximate position of chr16:29638676-30188531 in the reference genome (NCBI Build 38). Management Treatment of manifestations: Treatment should be targeted to the specific deficits identified.

Other findings include seizures (20%-35%), congenital heart disease, CNS abnormalities (hydrocephalus, dilated ventricles), umbilical/inguinal hernia, tracheomalacia, situs abnormalities, gastrointestinal abnormalities, and renal malformations. Wilms tumor has been reported in two individuals. Diagnosis/testing Chromosome analysis confirms the diagnosis of 2q37 deletion syndrome in 80%-85% of affected individuals. In about 15%-20% of cases the small size of the deleted region can only be detected using deletion analysis (which relies on a variety of methods). In some individuals, 2q37 microdeletion syndrome results from chromosome rearrangements involving 2q37 (e.g., chromosome 2 inversion, ring chromosome 2, or translocation between chromosome 2 and another chromosome). Mutation of HDAC4 has been proposed as causative for most of the features of the 2q37 microdeletion syndrome. Several affected individuals without microdeletions had inactivating mutation of HDAC4, a gene in the 2q37 deleted region, leading to the proposal that mutation of this gene may be causative for most of the features of the 2q37 microdeletion syndrome.

Management GeneReviews Treatment of manifestations: Multidisciplinary care by specialists in the following fields is often required: clinical genetics, speech pathology, occupational and physical therapy, child development, neurology, cardiology, gastroenterology, nutrition/feeding, ophthalmology, and audiology. Infants benefit from enrollment in an early- intervention program; most school-age children benefit from an individualized educational program (IEP). Surveillance: Ongoing routine primary care; periodic reevaluation by a clinical geneticist to provide new recommendations and information about the syndrome; periodic neurodevelopmental and/or developmental/ behavioral pediatric evaluation to assist in the management of cognitive and behavioral problems. Screening for renal cysts at age four years and again at puberty is suggested. For young children with a deletion that includes 2q37.1, screening for Wilms tumor can be considered. Evaluation of relatives at risk: It is reasonable to perform genetic testing of any young child at risk, so that Wilms tumor surveillance can be considered in those with a deletion that includes 2q37.1. Genetic counseling Most individuals with the 2q37 microdeletion syndrome have a de novo chromosome deletion and their parents have normal karyotypes. In approximately 5% of published cases, probands have inherited the deletion from a parent who is a balanced translocation carrier. The risk to sibs of a proband depends on the chromosome findings in the parents: the recurrence risk for future pregnancies is negligible when parental karyotypes are normal; if a parent has a balanced structural chromosome rearrangement, the risk to sibs is increased and depends on the specific chromosome rearrangement. Regarding risks to offspring: no individual with a cytogenetically visible 2q37 deletion is known to have reproduced; however, it is reasonable to expect normal fertility in mildly affected individuals with the 2q37 microdeletion syndrome. Prenatal diagnosis for pregnancies at increased risk is possible. Deletion or mutation of HDAC4 may be inherited in an autosomal dominant manner but is more commonly de novo."

Males younger than age ten years may manifest only LMW proteinuria and/or hypercalciuria, which are usually asymptomatic. Thirty to 80% of affected males develop end-stage renal disease (ESRD) between ages 30 and 50 years; in some instances ESRD does not develop until the sixth decade of life or later. The disease may also be accompanied by rickets or osteomalacia, growth restriction, and short stature. Disease severity can vary within the same family. Males with Dent disease 2 (caused by pathogenic variants in OCRL) may also have mild intellectual disability, cataracts, and/or elevated muscle enzymes. Due to random X-chromosome inactivation, some female carriers may manifest hypercalciuria and, rarely, renal calculi and moderate LMW proteinuria. Females rarely develop CKD. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis is established in a male proband with the typical clinical findings and a family history consistent with X-linked inheritance who has a pathogenic variant in either CLCN5 (known as Dent disease 1) or in OCRL (known as Dent disease 2). Heterozygous females are usually asymptomatic, but some exhibit LMW proteinuria and hypercalciuria, and others with kidney stones have also been described. Heterozygous females are most likely to be identified by familial molecular genetic testing related to a male proband. Management Treatment of manifestations: The primary goals of treatment are to decrease hypercalciuria, prevent kidney stones and nephrocalcinosis, and delay the progression of CKD.

While most individuals with DEPDC5-related epilepsy have a normal brain MRI, some have epilepsy associated with a cortical malformation, usually focal cortical dysplasia or hemimegalencephaly. Seizure syndromes include familial focal epilepsy with variable foci (FFEVF), autosomal dominant sleep-related hypermotor epilepsy (ADSHE), familial mesial temporal lobe epilepsies (FMTLE), autosomal dominant epilepsy with auditory features (ADEAF), infantile spasms, and severe developmental encephalopathy. Although psychomotor development is usually normal, developmental delays, intellectual disability, or autism spectrum disorder have been reported in some individuals. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of DEPDC5-related epilepsy is established in a proband with suggestive findings and at least one heterozygous pathogenic variant in DEPDC5 identified by molecular genetic testing. Some affected individuals have biallelic variants in DEPDC5, and some have a second mosaic (or postzygotic) DEPDC5 variant within the brain. Management Treatment of manifestations: The response to anti-seizure medication (ASM) is variable. While some individuals respond well to first-line ASMs, others are more refractory to treatment.

Repeat brain MRI with a higher-resolution technique in individuals with treatment- resistant seizures whose first brain MRI was normal to rule out subtle cortical dysplasia. Evaluation of relatives at risk: It is appropriate to clarify the genetic status of apparently asymptomatic older and younger at-risk relatives of an affected individual in order to identify those who are at risk for developing seizures as early as possible. This typically entails targeted molecular genetic testing for the known pathogenic variant(s) in the family. Pregnancy management: Pregnant women should receive counseling regarding the risks and benefits of using ASM during pregnancy; the advantages and disadvantages of increasing maternal periconceptional folic acid supplementation to 4,000 g daily; the effects of pregnancy on ASM metabolism; and the effect of pregnancy on maternal seizure control. Genetic counseling DEPDC5-related epilepsy is an autosomal dominant disorder; however, affected individuals with germline biallelic missense variants have been rarely reported. All probands reported to date with biallelic DEPDC5 variants inherited variants from their heterozygous parents. In these families, heterozygous parents may or may not have manifestations of DEPDC5-related epilepsy. The risk to the sibs of the proband depends on the genetic status of the proband's parents. If one parent of the proband has a DEPDC5 pathogenic variant, the risk to the sibs of inheriting the pathogenic variant is 50%. If both parents of a proband have a DEPDC5 pathogenic variant, sibs have a 75% chance of inheriting one or two pathogenic variants and a 25% chance of inheriting neither pathogenic variant and not being affected.

At younger ages, hearing loss tends to be mild in the low frequencies and moderate in the high frequencies; in older persons, the hearing loss is moderate in the low frequencies and severe to profound in the high frequencies. Although the hearing impairment is often detected during routine hearing assessment of a school-age child, it is likely that hearing is impaired from birth, especially at high frequencies.

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics GJB2-related autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss (GJB2-AR NSHL) is the most common genetic cause of congenital (present at birth) severe-to-profound non-progressive sensorineural hearing loss in many world populations. In countries where available, newborn hearing screening (NBHS) typically identifies severe- to-profound hearing loss. GJB2-AR NSHL can also be mild to moderate and is usually not progressive; however, it can progress. Congenital mild-to-moderate GJB2-AR NSHL is not detected by NBHS. GJB2-AR NSHL has no related systemic findings. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of GJB2-AR NSHL is established in a proband with suggestive findings and biallelic GJB2 pathogenic variants identified by molecular genetic testing. Of note: About 1% of individuals with GJB2-AR NSHL are compound heterozygotes for one GJB2 pathogenic variant and one of several different deletions that include sequences upstream of GJB2 (comprising either GJB6 and portions of CRYL1 or just portions of CRYL1) that delete cis-regulatory regions of GJB2, thereby abolishing GJB2 expression. Occasionally, the deletion also includes GJB2. Management Treatment of manifestations: It is recommended that NBHS be completed by age one month, the genetic diagnosis be established by age three months, and early intervention begun by age six months. (This recommendation is also known as \\\"the 1-3-6 benchmark.\\\") In the United States, the states that recommend the 1-3-6 benchmark should actually strive for a \\\"1-2-3\\\" timeline.

GeneReviews Because children with severe-to-profound hearing loss who are candidates for cochlear implantation can attain levels of social functioning and education indistinguishable from those of normal-hearing peers, cochlear implantation should be performed as soon as possible. Children with mild-to-moderate hearing loss can be treated with hearing aids customized to the child's age and severity of hearing loss. Surveillance: Most children with severe-to-profound GJB2-AR NSHL who are cochlear implant recipients initially require frequent follow-up visits with their cochlear implant team (otolaryngologist, audiologist, and speech-language pathologist) for assessment of speech recognition and equipment check. Once the cochlear implant recipient and their family become comfortable with the cochlear implant, many of these tasks can be performed by the family at home. All children with mild-to-moderate GJB2-AR NSHL require follow-up audiograms annually to detect any progression of hearing loss. Children using hearing aids typically have an annual evaluation by an otolaryngologist, audiologist, and hearing aid specialist to examine the ears, obtain an audiogram, and check hearing aid function. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Individuals with mild-to-moderate hearing loss should avoid environmental exposures known to cause hearing loss. Most important for persons with GJB2-related mild-to-moderate hearing loss is avoidance of repeated overexposure to loud noises (i.e., >75 decibels), particularly secondary to earbud use. Note that the headphone safety feature built into many smartphones can be set to a maximum limit of decibels. Evaluation of relatives at risk: With limited exceptions, it is appropriate to clarify the genetic status of sibs of a proband with GJB2-AR NSHL; early identification of infants and children with hearing loss allows appropriate support and management to be provided to the child and family. Genetic counseling GJB2-AR NSHL is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. The parents of a child with GJB2-AR NSHL are typically heterozygous for a GJB2 pathogenic variant. In populations with a high carrier rate, it is possible that either one or both parents of a child with GJB2-AR NSHL also have GJB2-AR NSHL. If both parents are known to be heterozygous for a pathogenic variant, each sib of an individual with GJB2-AR NSHL has at conception a 25% chance of inheriting biallelic pathogenic variants and having hearing loss, a 50% chance of inheriting one pathogenic variant, and a 25% chance of inheriting neither of the familial GJB2 pathogenic variants. Once the GJB2 pathogenic variants have been identified in a family member with GJB2-AR NSHL, prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing for GJB2-AR NSHL are possible."

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics OTOF-related deafness is characterized by two phenotypes: prelingual nonsyndromic auditory neuropathy spectrum disorder (ANSD) and, less frequently, temperature-sensitive auditory neuropathy spectrum disorder (TS-ANSD). OTOF-related ANSD is characterized by congenital or prelingual, typically severe-to-profound bilateral deafness without inner-ear anomalies on MRI or CT examination of the temporal bones. Otoacoustic emissions (OAEs) are present and auditory brain stem response is abnormal at birth. Newborn hearing screening testing of OAEs only will fail to detect this disorder in most individuals. OAEs may decrease or disappear with age in 20%-80% of individuals. TS-ANSD typically presents with normal-to-moderate hearing loss (0-55 dB) at baseline body temperature. An elevation of body temperature (approximately 0.5C or more) triggers significant bilateral hearing loss ranging from severe to profound, with resolution of hearing loss typically occurring within hours of a return to baseline body temperature. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of OTOF-related deafness is established in a proband with suggestive findings and biallelic pathogenic variants in OTOF identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Hearing aids should be fitted as soon as possible after hearing loss is identified.

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA) is characterized by a profound normochromic and usually macrocytic anemia with normal leukocytes and platelets, congenital malformations in up to 50%, and growth deficiency in 30% of affected individuals. The hematologic complications occur in 90% of affected individuals during the first year of life. The phenotypic spectrum ranges from a mild form (e.g., mild anemia or no anemia with only subtle erythroid abnormalities, physical malformations without anemia) to a severe form of fetal anemia resulting in nonimmune hydrops fetalis. DBA is associated with an increased risk for acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and solid tumors including osteogenic sarcoma. Diagnosis/testing The clinical diagnosis can be established in a proband with macrocytic anemia with onset prior to age one year, no other significant cytopenias, reticulocytopenia, normal marrow cellularity with a paucity of erythroid precursors, and no evidence of another acquired or inherited disorder of bone marrow function. The molecular diagnosis can be established in a female proband by identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in one of the 22 genes associated with DBA. The molecular diagnosis can be established in a male proband by identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in a gene associated with autosomal dominant DBA or identification of a hemizygous pathogenic variant in GATA1 or TSR2 (associated with X-linked inheritance). Management Treatment of manifestations: Corticosteroid treatment, recommended in children older than age 12 months, improves the red blood cell count in approximately 80% of affected individuals. Chronic transfusion with packed red blood cells is necessary during the first year of life to avoid steroid-induced toxicity in those not responsive to a trial of corticosteroids at age 12 months and in individuals who relapse.

Copyright 1993-2024, University of Washington, Seattle. GeneReviews is a registered trademark of the University of Washington, Seattle. All rights reserved. GeneReviews transplantation, the only curative therapy for the hematologic manifestations of DBA, is often recommended for those who are transfusion dependent or develop other cytopenias. Ocular, skeletal, genitourinary, cardiac, and endocrine complications are best managed in collaboration with appropriate subspecialists. Treatment of malignancies should be coordinated by an oncologist. Chemotherapy must be given cautiously as it may lead to prolonged cytopenia and subsequent toxicities. Prevention of secondary complications: Transfusion-related iron overload is the most common complication in transfusion-dependent individuals. Iron chelation therapy with deferasirox orally or desferrioxamine subcutaneously is recommended after ten to 12 transfusions. Corticosteroid-related side effects must also be closely monitored, especially as related to risk for infection, growth deficiency, and loss of bone density in growing children. Often individuals will be placed on transfusion therapy if these side effects are intolerable. Surveillance: Complete blood counts several times a year; bone marrow aspirate/biopsy to evaluate morphology and cellularity only in the event of another cytopenia or a change in response to treatment. In steroid-dependent individuals: monitor blood pressure and (in children) growth. Evaluation by an endocrinologist for those who are steroid dependent and those at risk for transfusion iron overload. Cancer surveillance includes history, physical examination, and blood counts every four to six months. If red blood cell, white blood cell, or platelet counts fall rapidly, bone marrow aspirate with biopsy and cytogenetic studies (including karyotype and FISH analysis) to look for acquired abnormalities in chromosomes 5, 7, and 8 that are associated with myelodysplastic syndrome or leukemia. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Deferiprone for the treatment of iron overload (which can cause neutropenia); infection (especially in individuals on corticosteroids). Evaluation of relatives at risk: Molecular genetic testing of at-risk relatives of a proband with a known pathogenic variant allows for early diagnosis and appropriate monitoring for bone marrow failure, physical abnormalities, and related cancers. Pregnancy management: Management by an obstetrician with expertise in high-risk pregnancies and hematologists with experience in bone marrow failure syndromes. During pregnancy the maternal hemoglobin level must be monitored. Use of low-dose aspirin up to 37 weeks' gestation may help prevent vasculo-placental complications in women with a history of a problematic pregnancy. Genetic counseling DBA is most often inherited in an autosomal dominant manner; GATA1-related and TSR2-related DBA are inherited in an X-linked manner. Autosomal dominant. Approximately 40%-45% of individuals with autosomal dominant DBA have inherited the pathogenic variant from a parent; approximately 55%-60% have a de novo pathogenic variant. Each child of an individual with autosomal dominant DBA has a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant. X-linked. Males with GATA1- or TSR2-related DBA pass the pathogenic variant to all of their daughters and none of their sons. Women heterozygous for a GATA1 or TSR2 pathogenic variant have a 50% chance of transmitting the pathogenic variant in each pregnancy: males who inherit the pathogenic variant will be affected; females who inherit the pathogenic variant will be carriers and will usually not be affected. Carrier testing of at-risk female relatives is possible if the GATA1 or TSR2 pathogenic variant has been identified in the family. Once the DBA-causing pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.

Other typical findings are ulnar deviation of the fingers, gap between the first and second toes, and clubfoot. On occasion, the disease can be lethal at birth, but most affected individuals survive the neonatal period and develop physical limitations with normal intelligence. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of DTD is established in a proband with characteristic clinical and radiographic features and/or biallelic pathogenic variants in SLC26A2 identified by molecular genetic testing.

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Dyskeratosis congenita and related telomere biology disorders (DC/TBD) are caused by impaired telomere maintenance resulting in short or very short telomeres. The phenotypic spectrum of telomere biology disorders is broad and includes individuals with classic dyskeratosis congenita (DC) as well as those with very short telomeres and an isolated physical finding. Classic DC is characterized by a triad of dysplastic nails, lacy reticular pigmentation of the upper chest and/or neck, and oral leukoplakia, although this may not be present in all individuals. People with DC/TBD are at increased risk for progressive bone marrow failure (BMF), myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myelogenous leukemia, solid tumors (usually squamous cell carcinoma of the head/neck or anogenital cancer), and pulmonary fibrosis. Other findings can include eye abnormalities (epiphora, blepharitis, sparse eyelashes, ectropion, entropion, trichiasis), taurodontism, liver disease, gastrointestinal telangiectasias, and avascular necrosis of the hips or shoulders. Although most persons with DC/TBD have normal psychomotor development and normal neurologic function, significant developmental delay is present in both forms; additional findings include cerebellar hypoplasia (Hoyeraal Hreidarsson syndrome) and bilateral exudative retinopathy and intracranial calcifications (Revesz syndrome and Coats plus syndrome). Onset and progression of manifestations of DC/TBD vary: at the mild end of the spectrum are those who have only minimal physical findings with normal bone marrow function, and at the severe end are those who have the diagnostic triad and early-onset BMF. Diagnosis/testing A majority of individuals with DC/TBD have abnormally short telomeres for their age, as determined by multicolor flow cytometry fluorescence in situ hybridization (flow-FISH) on lymphocyte subsets.

GeneReviews ZCCHC8 are the genes in which pathogenic variants are known to cause DC/TBD and to result in very short telomeres. Pathogenic variants in one of these 16 genes have been identified in approximately 80% of individuals who meet clinical diagnostic criteria for DC/TBD. Management Treatment of manifestations: Treatment is tailored to the individual. Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is the only curative treatment for BMF and leukemia, but long-term outcome has historically been poor due to treatment toxicity; if a suitable donor is not available, androgen therapy may be considered for BMF. Treatment of other cancers is tailored to the type of cancer. Of note, cancer therapy may pose an increased risk for prolonged cytopenias as well as pulmonary and hepatic toxicity. Treatment of pulmonary fibrosis is primarily supportive, although lung transplantation may be considered. Surveillance: For BMF: complete blood count (CBC) annually if normal and more often if abnormal; annual bone marrow aspirate and biopsy. For those on androgen therapy: routine monitoring of CBC, liver function, liver ultrasound, and endocrinology evaluation. For cancer risk: monthly self-examination for oral, head, and neck cancer; annual cancer screening by an otolaryngologist and dermatologist; annual gynecologic examination. For pulmonary fibrosis: annual pulmonary function tests starting either at diagnosis or when the individual can perform the test (often age ~8 years); bubble echocardiogram to look for pulmonary arteriovenous malformations if suspected based on clinical symptoms. Routine dental screening every six months and good oral hygiene are recommended. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Blood donation by family members if HCT is being considered; non- leukodepleted and non-irradiated blood products; the combination of androgens and granulocyte colony- stimulating factor in treatment of BMF (has been associated with splenic rupture); toxic agents implicated in tumorigenesis (e.g., smoking, excessive sun exposure). Evaluation of relatives at risk: If a relative has signs or symptoms suggestive of DC/TBD or is being evaluated as a potential HCT donor, telomere length testing or, if the pathogenic variant(s) in the family are known, molecular genetic testing is warranted. Genetic counseling The mode of inheritance of DC/TBD varies by gene: X-linked: DKC1 Autosomal dominant: NAF1, RPA1, TERC, TINF2, and ZCCHC8 Autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive: ACD, PARN, RTEL1, and TERT Autosomal recessive: CTC1, NHP2, NOP10, POT1, STN1, and WRAP53 Genetic counseling regarding risk to family members depends on accurate diagnosis, determination of the mode of inheritance in each family, and results of molecular genetic testing. Once the DC/TBD-related pathogenic variant(s) have been identified in an affected family member, prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing are possible."

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics The phenotypes of dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (DLD) deficiency are an overlapping continuum that ranges from early-onset neurologic manifestations to adult-onset liver involvement and, rarely, a myopathic presentation. Early-onset DLD deficiency typically manifests in infancy as hypotonia with lactic acidosis. Affected infants frequently do not survive their initial metabolic decompensation, or die within the first few years of life during a recurrent metabolic decompensation. Children who live beyond the first two to three years frequently exhibit growth deficiencies and residual neurologic deficits (intellectual disability, spasticity, ataxia, and seizures). In contrast, isolated liver involvement can present as early as the neonatal period and as late as the third decade. Evidence of liver injury/failure is preceded by nausea and emesis and frequently associated with encephalopathy and/or coagulopathy. Acute metabolic episodes are frequently associated with lactate elevations, hyperammonemia, and hepatomegaly. With resolution of the acute episodes affected individuals frequently return to baseline with no residual neurologic deficit or intellectual disability. Liver failure can result in death, even in those with late-onset disease. Individuals with the myopathic presentation may experience muscle cramps, weakness, and an elevated creatine kinase. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase deficiency (DLD) is established in a proband with suggestive clinical and supportive laboratory findings and/or by identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in DLD. Management Treatment of manifestations: Routine daily treatment for those with the early-onset neurologic presentation: protein intake at approximately recommended dietary allowance (RDA); if there is evidence of significant hyperleucinosis, protein intake should consist of branched-chain amino acid (BCAA)-free powder formula with 2-3 Author Affiliations: 1 Clinical Assistant Professor University of Michigan Ann Arbor, Michigan; Email: squinon@med.umich.edu. 2 Active Emeritus Professor of Pediatrics University of Michigan Ann Arbor, Michigan; Email: jthoene@med.umich.edu.

Acute inpatient treatment for those with early-onset neurologic presentation: address any precipitating factors (infection, fasting, medications); D10 (half or full-normal saline) with age-appropriate electrolytes; consideration of bicarbonate therapy for those with severe metabolic acidosis; withholding of protein for a maximum of 24 hours; consideration of renal replacement therapies; total protein intake at RDA; if there is evidence of significant hyperleucinosis, protein intake should be adjusted to provide 2-3.5 g/kg/day as BCAA-free amino acids; isoleucine and valine supplements; maintain serum osmolality within the normal reference range; levocarnitine (IV or PO) 50-100 mg/kg/day divided three times per day; continuation of DCA; standard therapy for seizures. For hepatic presentation: removal or treatment of precipitating factors; dextrose-containing IV fluids (6-8 mg/kg/min) with age-appropriate electrolytes and/or frequent feedings; consider correction of metabolic acidosis using sodium bicarbonate; consideration of DCA and/or dialysis; consideration of fresh frozen plasma for coagulopathy. For the myopathic presentation: At least one affected individual with severe exercise intolerance responded well to riboflavin supplementation (220 mg/day). Prevention of primary manifestations: No compelling evidence exists for the prevention of acute episodes, despite multiple attempted dietary strategies and medications.

Surveillance: Measurement of growth parameters and evaluation of nutritional status and safety of oral intake at each visit; full amino acid profile (from plasma or filter paper) weekly or twice weekly in rapidly growing infants and routinely in older individuals; at least monthly visit with a metabolic specialist in infancy; assessment of developmental milestones at each visit or as needed; physical examination and/or ultrasound to assess liver size, measurement of liver transaminases and liver synthetic function, and assessment for peripheral neuropathy at each visit; echocardiogram at least annually or based on clinical status; ophthalmologic evaluation as clinically indicated. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Fasting, catabolic stressors, and extremes of dietary intake until dietary tolerance/ stressors are identified; liver-toxic medications. Evaluation of relatives at risk: Testing of all at-risk sibs of any age is warranted to allow for early diagnosis and treatment of DLD deficiency and to avoid risk factors that may precipitate an acute event. For at-risk newborn sibs when molecular genetic prenatal testing was not performed: in parallel with NBS either test for the familial DLD pathogenic variants or measure plasma lactate, plasma amino acids, and urine organic acids. Genetic counseling DLD deficiency is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. At conception, each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Carrier testing for at-risk relatives and prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk are possible if the DLD pathogenic variants in the family are known. Dehydrogenase Deficiency 3"

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus (PNDM) is characterized by the onset of hyperglycemia within the first six months of life (mean age: 7 weeks; range: birth to 26 weeks). The diabetes mellitus is associated with partial or complete insulin deficiency. Clinical manifestations at the time of diagnosis include intrauterine growth restriction, hyperglycemia, glycosuria, osmotic polyuria, severe dehydration, and failure to thrive. Therapy with insulin corrects the hyperglycemia and results in dramatic catch-up growth. The course of PNDM varies by genotype. Diagnosis/testing Persistent hyperglycemia (plasma glucose concentration >150-200 mg/dL) in infants younger than age six months establishes the diagnosis of PNDM. Molecular testing is recommended: identification of pathogenic variant(s) in ABCC8 or KCNJ11 can guide treatment. Management Treatment of manifestations: Start rehydration and intravenous insulin infusion promptly after diagnosis. When the infant is stable and tolerating oral feedings begin subcutaneous insulin therapy. Children with pathogenic variants in ABCC8 or KCNJ11 can be treated with oral sulfonylureas; all others require long-term insulin therapy. High caloric intake is necessary for appropriate weight gain. Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy is required for those with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. Prevention of secondary complications: Aggressive treatment and frequent monitoring of blood glucose concentrations to avoid acute complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis and hypoglycemia and reduce the long-term complications of diabetes mellitus.

GeneReviews Surveillance: Lifelong monitoring of blood glucose concentrations at least four times a day; periodic developmental evaluations. After age ten years, annual screening for chronic complications of diabetes mellitus including urinalysis for microalbuminuria and ophthalmologic examination for retinopathy. Agents/circumstances to avoid: In general, avoid rapid-acting insulin preparations (lispro and aspart) as well as short-acting (regular) insulin preparations (except as a continuous intravenous or subcutaneous infusion) as they may cause severe hypoglycemia in young children. Genetic counseling The mode of inheritance of PNDM is autosomal dominant for mutation of KCNJ11, autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive for mutation of ABCC8 and INS, and autosomal recessive for mutation of GCK and PDX1. Individuals with autosomal dominant PNDM may have an affected parent or may have a de novo pathogenic variant. Each child of an individual with autosomal dominant PNDM has a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant. The parents of a child with autosomal recessive PNDM are obligate heterozygotes and therefore carry one pathogenic variant. Heterozygotes for pathogenic variants in GCK and PDX1 have a mild form of diabetes mellitus known as GCK-familial monogenic diabetes (formerly known as MODY2) and PDX1-familial monogenic diabetes (formerly known as MODY4). At conception, each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier (or of having familial monogenic diabetes), and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Prenatal diagnosis for pregnancies at increased risk is possible if the pathogenic variant(s) in the family are known."

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics 6q24-related transient neonatal diabetes mellitus (6q24-TNDM) is defined as transient neonatal diabetes mellitus caused by genetic aberrations of the imprinted locus at 6q24. The cardinal features are: severe intrauterine growth restriction, hyperglycemia that begins in the neonatal period in a term infant and resolves by age 18 months, dehydration, and absence of ketoacidosis. Macroglossia and umbilical hernia may be present. 6q24-TNDM associated with a multilocus imprinting disturbance (MLID) can be associated with marked hypotonia, congenital heart disease, deafness, neurologic features including epilepsy, and renal malformations. Diabetes mellitus usually starts within the first week of life and lasts on average three months but can last longer than a year. Although insulin is usually required initially, the need for insulin gradually declines over time. Intermittent episodes of hyperglycemia may occur in childhood, particularly during intercurrent illnesses. Diabetes mellitus may recur in adolescence or later in adulthood. Women who have had 6q24-TNDM are at risk for relapse during pregnancy. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of 6q24-TNDM is established in a proband with transient neonatal diabetes mellitus and DNA methylation analysis demonstrating relative hypomethylation within the 6q24 differentially methylated region (DMR). 6q24-TNDM is caused by overexpression of the imprinted genes at 6q24 (PLAGL1 and HYMAI). The DMR (i.e., PLAGL1 TSS alt-DMR) is present within the shared promoter of these genes. Normally, expression of the maternal alleles of PLAGL1 and HYMAI is silenced by DMR methylation and only the paternal alleles of PLAGL1 and HYMAI are expressed. Additional molecular genetic testing can establish the underlying genetic mechanism, which is required for genetic counseling. Three different genetic mechanisms resulting in twice the normal dosage of PLAGL1 and HYMAI (and thus causing 6q24-TNDM) are (1) paternal uniparental disomy of Author Affiliations: 1 Professor of Medical Genetics, Human Genetics and Genomic Medicine, Academic Unit of Human Development and Health, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Honorary Consultant in Clinical Genetics, Wessex Clinical Genetics Service, University Hospital Southampton NHS Trust, Southampton, Hampshire, United Kingdom; Email: ikt@southampton.ac.uk. 2 Professor of Medical Epigenetics, Human Genetics and Genomic Medicine, Academic Unit of Human Development and Health, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, Hampshire, United Kingdom; Email: djgm@southampton.ac.uk. 3 Wessex Regional Genetics Laboratory, Salisbury NHS Foundation Trust, Salisbury, Wiltshire, United Kingdom; Email: djgm@southampton.ac.uk.

GeneReviews chromosome 6, (2) duplication of 6q24 on the paternal allele, and (3) hypomethylation of the maternal PLAGL1 TSS alt-DMR, resulting in inappropriate expression of the maternal PLAGL1 and HYMAI alleles. Maternal PLAGL1 TSS alt-DMR hypomethylation may result from an isolated imprinting variant or as part of MLID. Biallelic ZFP57 pathogenic variants account for almost half of TNDM-MLID. Management Treatment of manifestations: Rehydration and IV insulin are usually required at the time of diagnosis; subcutaneous insulin is introduced as soon as possible and used until blood glucose levels stabilize. Later recurrence of diabetes may require diet modifications alone, oral agents, or insulin. Prevention of secondary complications: Prompt treatment of dehydration to avoid sequelae. Surveillance: Periodic glucose tolerance tests (abnormalities suggest future recurrence); monitoring of growth and development. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Factors that predispose to late-onset diabetes or risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Evaluation of relatives at risk: Screening for diabetes mellitus in relatives who have inherited a paternal 6q24 duplication or who are at risk of having inherited two ZFP57 pathogenic variants. Genetic counseling The risk to sibs and offspring of a proband of having 6q24-TNDM or of developing diabetes later in life depends on the genetic mechanism in the family. Recurrence risk counseling by a genetics professional is strongly recommended. 6q24-TNDM caused by paternal UPD6 is typically a de novo, non-recurrent event. 6q24-TNDM caused by paternal duplication of 6q24 can occur de novo, be inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, or be inherited as part of a complex chromosome rearrangement; TNDM caused by inherited duplication of 6q24 may recur in sibs and offspring of a proband if the duplication is inherited from the father. Prenatal diagnosis of paternal duplication of 6q24 is possible in pregnancies at risk for a structural chromosome abnormality. TNDM caused by hypomethylation of the PLAGL1 TSS alt-DMR is a de novo non-recurrent event in the majority of individuals, particularly if hypomethylation is restricted to this DMR and does not affect other imprinted loci. However, TNDM as part of a multilocus imprinting disturbance (TNDM-MLID) has a significant genetic component. TNDM-MLID is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner when caused by pathogenic variants in ZFP57; however, the phenotype of homozygous or compound heterozygous sibs is variable and cannot be predicted by molecular genetic testing. Pathogenic variants in additional genes are suspected of causing TNDM- MLID but are currently unknown. Therefore, caution should be exercised when counseling the heritability of TNDM associated with imprinting disturbance at the PLAGL1 TSS alt-DMR."

DNMT1 disorder is often characterized by moderate-to-severe sensorineural hearing loss beginning in the teens or early 20s, sensory impairment, sudomotor dysfunction (loss of sweating), and dementia usually beginning in the mid-40s. In some affected individuals, narcolepsy/cataplexy syndrome and ataxia are predominant findings. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of DNMT1 disorder is established by identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in DNMT1 by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: No cure for DNMT1 disorder currently exists. The emphasis of management is to help affected individuals and their caregivers understand the sudomotor defect and injury prevention when sensory impairment is significant. Because hearing loss may be severe, initial use of hearing aids and/or assistive communication methods may be needed. Sedative or antipsychotic drugs help to reduce extreme restlessness, roaming behavior, delusions, and hallucinations associated with dementia. Because behavioral changes and the loss of insight and judgment often present a considerable burden for partners or other caregivers, information about the disorder and psychological support for partners or other caregivers are essential.

This disorder typically presents with gait disturbance caused by foot dystonia, later development of parkinsonism, and diurnal fluctuation of symptoms (aggravation of symptoms toward the evening and alleviation of symptoms in the morning after sleep). Initial symptoms are often gait difficulties attributable to flexion-inversion (equinovarus posture) of the foot. Occasionally, initial symptoms are arm dystonia, postural tremor of the hand, or slowness of movements. Brisk deep-tendon reflexes in the legs, ankle clonus, and/or the striatal toe (dystonic extension of the big toe) are present in many affected individuals. In general, gradual progression to generalized dystonia is observed. Intellectual, cerebellar, sensory, and autonomic disturbances generally do not occur. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of GTPCH1-deficient DRD is established in a proband by identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in GCH1 by molecular genetic testing. In individuals with a suspected diagnosis of GTPCH1- deficient DRD and no identifiable GCH1 pathogenic variants, biochemical testing may be necessary. Management Treatment of manifestations: Initial suggested dose of levodopa/decarboxylase inhibitor (DCI): Children age <6 years: 1-10 mg/kg levodopa/DCI daily, administered in multiple doses Children age 6 years: 25-50 mg levodopa/DCI 1-3x daily Author Affiliation: 1 Chairman, Department of Neurology Vice President, Juntendo Tokyo Koto Geriatric Medical Center Professor, Department of Neurology Faculty of Medicine Juntendo University Tokyo, Japan; Email: furukawa@juntendo.gmc.ac.jp.

GeneReviews Adults: 50 mg levodopa/DCI 1-3x daily For all, dose should be changed slowly and by small increments as needed. Motor benefit occurs immediately or within a few days of starting levodopa; full benefit occurs within several days to a few months. Maximum benefit (complete or near-complete responsiveness of symptoms) is generally achieved by <300-400 mg/day of levodopa/DCI. Although dyskinesias may appear at the beginning of levodopa therapy, they subside following dose reduction and do not reappear when the dose is gradually increased. Typically, adverse motor effects of chronic levodopa therapy (motor response fluctuations and dopa-induced dyskinesias) do not occur. Prevention of secondary complications: Early diagnosis and therapy (with low doses of levodopa) may prevent transient dyskinesias at initiation of levodopa treatment. Surveillance: Examination by a movement disorder specialist at least several times yearly is recommended. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Discontinuation of levodopa treatment. Evaluation of relatives at risk: It is appropriate to clarify the genetic status of apparently asymptomatic older and younger at-risk relatives of an affected individual in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from prompt initiation of treatment. Molecular genetic testing cannot be used to predict the occurrence of symptoms, age of onset, severity and type of symptoms, or rate of disease progression in family members who are heterozygous for a GCH1 pathogenic variant. Pregnancy management: Levodopa therapy is continued during pregnancy without adverse effect in most. Genetic counseling GTPCH1-deficient DRD is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Affected individuals often have an affected parent with typical GTPCH1-deficient DRD or adult-onset parkinsonism caused by a GCH1 pathogenic variant. A proband with GTPCH1-deficient DRD may have the disorder as the result of a de novo pathogenic variant. Every child of an individual with autosomal dominant GTPCH1-deficient DRD has a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant. However, because of sex-related incomplete penetrance (i.e., higher penetrance in women than in men), it is not possible to predict whether offspring with a GCH1 pathogenic variant will develop symptoms."

The lateral movement anomaly results from failure of the abducens nucleus and nerve (cranial nerve VI) to fully innervate the lateral rectus muscle; globe retraction occurs as a result of abnormal innervation of the lateral rectus muscle by the oculomotor nerve (cranial nerve III). At birth, affected infants have restricted ability to move the affected eye(s) outward (abduction) and/or inward (adduction), though the limitations may not be recognized in early infancy. In addition, the globe retracts into the orbit with attempted adduction, accompanied by narrowing of the palpebral fissure. Many individuals with Duane syndrome have strabismus in primary gaze but can use a compensatory head turn to align the eyes, and thus can preserve binocular vision and avoid diplopia. Individuals with Duane syndrome who lack binocular vision are at risk for amblyopia. The majority of affected individuals with Duane syndrome have isolated Duane syndrome (i.e., they do not have other detected congenital anomalies). Other individuals with Duane syndrome fall into well-defined syndromic diagnoses. However, many individuals with Duane syndrome have non-ocular findings that do not fit a known syndrome; these individuals are included as part of the discussion of nonsyndromic Duane syndrome. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of Duane syndrome is usually made by an ophthalmologist based on clinical findings. More than 98% of individuals with isolated Duane syndrome and no family history lack an identified genetic etiology.

GeneReviews Molecular genetic testing for a pathogenic variant in CHN1, MAFB, or SALL4 is most appropriate for those with a positive family history of isolated Duane syndrome (although de novo pathogenic variants in these genes have been detected in some simplex cases) and for those with clinical ocular findings designated as type I or type III Duane syndrome. Management Treatment of manifestations: Spectacles or contact lenses for refractive error; occlusion or penalization of the better-seeing eye for treatment of amblyopia; prism glasses (usually in older individuals with mild involvement) to improve the compensatory head position; extraocular muscle surgery to address alignment in primary gaze, compensatory head posture, and upshoot or downshoot. Prevention of secondary complications: Amblyopia therapy to prevent vision loss in the less preferred eye; extraocular muscle surgery to prevent loss of binocular vision in individuals who abandon the compensatory head posture and allow strabismus to become manifest, and to prevent neck muscle problems in those with large compensatory head postures. Surveillance: Ophthalmologic visits every three to six months during the first years of life to prevent, detect, and treat amblyopia; annual or biannual examinations once the presence of binocular vision and reduced risk for amblyopia is confirmed, and in all individuals older than age seven to 12; no surveillance in adulthood beyond public health guidelines. Evaluation of relatives at risk: Eye examination within the first year of life so that early diagnosis and treatment can prevent secondary complications. Genetic counseling The majority of individuals with isolated Duane syndrome represent simplex cases (i.e., a single occurrence in a family), with a positive family history apparent for only approximately 10% of affected individuals. Duane syndrome resulting from a CHN1, MAFB, or SALL4 pathogenic variant is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Most individuals with isolated CHN1-, MAFB-, or SALL4-related Duane syndrome have the disorder as the result of a pathogenic variant inherited from an affected parent. Each child of an individual with Duane syndrome resulting from an identified pathogenic variant has a 50% chance of inheriting the variant. Prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing are possible once the causative pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member."

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Infants with Duarte variant galactosemia who receive breast milk or a high galactose-containing formula (dairy milk-based formula) are typically asymptomatic and show the same prevalence of acute issues seen in the general newborn population. For decades it has been unclear whether Duarte variant galactosemia results in long-term developmental problems either with or without dietary intervention. However, a recent study of 350 children ages six to 12 years reported no detectable differences in developmental outcomes tested between children with Duarte variant galactosemia and controls, or among children with Duarte variant galactosemia as a function of galactose exposure in infancy. Premature ovarian insufficiency, which is common in classic galactosemia, also has not been reported for girls or women with Duarte variant galactosemia. Diagnosis/testing Duarte variant galactosemia is diagnosed by a combination of biochemical and genetic testing. Specifically, erythrocyte galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase (GALT) enzyme activity is typically about 25% of control activity, and GALT genotyping reveals the presence of one heterozygous pathogenic GALT variant together with either a heterozygous or homozygous Duarte (D2) GALT variant. Management Treatment of manifestations: Currently, there is no uniform standard of care regarding restriction of dietary galactose for infants with Duarte variant galactosemia. Thus, some health care providers, or parents, may choose to restrict dietary galactose in the first year of life, while others may not. When dietary galactose is restricted in infancy, centers often perform a galactose challenge around age one year followed by measurement of the erythrocyte galactose-1-phosphate level.

GeneReviews of galactose is generally discontinued. When dietary galactose is not restricted in infancy, some health care providers may still choose to check the erythrocyte galactose-1-phosphate level at age one year to confirm that the level is approaching the normal range. Surveillance: For infants on dietary restriction of galactose: if the erythrocyte galactose-1-phosphate level is >1.0 mg/dL following a galactose challenge at age one year, galactose restriction may be resumed. In this case, the galactose challenge and measurement of erythrocyte galactose-1-phosphate level may be repeated every four to six months until the erythrocyte galactose-1-phosphate level stabilizes at <1.0 mg/dL. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Opinion varies as to whether avoidance of all dairy products (including breast milk and dairy milk-based formula) until age one year is warranted. Evaluation of relatives at risk: If families with one child with Duarte variant galactosemia wish to evaluate their other children for Duarte variant galactosemia, molecular genetic testing for the GALT variants identified in the family can be performed. Genetic counseling Duarte variant galactosemia is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. When one parent is heterozygous for the GALT D2 allele and the other parent is heterozygous for a GALT pathogenic variant, each child has a 25% chance of having Duarte variant galactosemia, a 25% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier of the D2 allele, a 25% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier of the GALT pathogenic variant, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and also not a carrier of either GALT variant. Carrier testing for at-risk relatives and prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk requires prior identification of the GALT variants in the family and determination of the parental origin of each allele."

Rarely, maternal dup15q may also be associated with psychosis or sudden unexplained death. Those with a maternal isodicentric 15q11.2-q13.1 supernumerary chromosome are typically more severely affected than those with an interstitial duplication. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of maternal dup15q is established by detection of at least one extra maternally derived copy of the Prader-Willi/Angelman critical region, a region approximately 5 Mb long within chromosome region 15q11.2- q13.1. The extra copy or copies most commonly arise by one of two mechanisms: A maternal isodicentric 15q11.2-q13.1 supernumerary chromosome idic(15) typically comprising two extra copies of 15q11.2-q13.1 and resulting in tetrasomy for 15q11.2-q13.1 (~60-80%); A maternal interstitial 15q11.2-q13.1 duplication that typically includes one extra copy of 15q11.2-q13.1 within chromosome 15, resulting in trisomy for 15q11.2-q13.1 (~20-40%).

Management Treatment of manifestations: Acetazolamide is effective in controlling or reducing the frequency and severity of attacks in most individuals; typical starting dose is 125 mg a day given orally, but doses as high as 500 mg twice a day may be required. Acetazolamide is generally well tolerated; the most common side effects are paresthesias of the extremities, rash, and renal calculi. Acetazolamide does not appear to prevent the progression of interictal symptoms. Studies have also demonstrated that 4-aminopyridine in doses of 5-10 mg/3x/day can also be effective in reducing attack frequency and duration. Surveillance: Annual neurologic examination. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Phenytoin has been reported to exacerbate symptoms.

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (DEB) is a genetic skin disorder affecting skin and nails that usually presents at birth. DEB is divided into two major types depending on inheritance pattern: recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB) and dominant dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (DDEB). Each type is further divided into multiple clinical subtypes. Absence of a known family history of DEB does not preclude the diagnosis. Clinical findings in severe generalized RDEB include skin fragility manifest by blistering with minimal trauma that heals with milia and scarring. Blistering and erosions affecting the whole body may be present in the neonatal period. Oral involvement may lead to mouth blistering, fusion of the tongue to the floor of the mouth, and progressive diminution of the size of the oral cavity. Esophageal erosions can lead to webs and strictures that can cause severe dysphagia. Consequently, malnutrition and vitamin and mineral deficiency may lead to growth restriction in young children. Corneal erosions can lead to scarring and loss of vision. Blistering of the hands and feet followed by scarring fuses the digits into \\\"mitten\\\" hands and feet, with contractures and pseudosyndactyly. The lifetime risk of aggressive squamous cell carcinoma is higher than 90%. In contrast, the blistering in the less severe forms of RDEB may be localized to hands, feet, knees, and elbows with or without involvement of flexural areas and the trunk, and without the mutilating scarring seen in severe generalized RDEB. In DDEB, blistering is often mild and limited to hands, feet, knees, and elbows, but nonetheless heals with scarring. Dystrophic nails, especially toenails, are common and may be the only manifestation of DDEB. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of DEB is established in a proband with characteristic clinical findings and the identification of biallelic pathogenic variants (RDEB) or a heterozygous pathogenic variant (DDEB) in COL7A1 by molecular Author Affiliations: 1 Director, EBDx Program, GeneDx, Inc, Gaithersburg, Maryland; Email: ellen@genedx.com. 2 Medical Director, Cincinnati Children's Epidermolysis Bullosa Center, Cincinnati Children's Hospital, Cincinnati, Ohio; Email: anne.lucky@cchmc.org.

The only gene in which pathogenic variants are known to cause DEB is COL7A1. If molecular genetic testing is not diagnostic, examination of a skin biopsy with direct immunofluorescence (IF) for specific cutaneous markers and/or electron microscopy (EM) may be necessary for diagnosis. Management Treatment of manifestations: New blisters should be lanced, drained, and in most cases dressed with a nonadherent material, covered with padding for stability and protection, and secured with an elastic wrap for integrity. Infants and children with severe generalized RDEB and poor growth require attention to fluid and electrolyte balance and may require nutritional support, including feeding gastrostomy. Anemia is treated with iron supplements and transfusions as needed. Other nutritional supplements may include calcium, vitamin D, selenium, carnitine, and zinc. Occupational therapy may help prevent hand contractures. Surgical release of fingers often needs to be repeated. Prevention of primary manifestations: If a fetus is known to be affected with any form of DEB, cesarean delivery may reduce trauma to the skin during delivery; age-appropriate play involving activities that cause minimal trauma to the skin is encouraged; dressings and padding are needed to protect bony prominences from blister- inducing impact. Surveillance: Beginning in the second decade of life, biopsies of abnormal-appearing wounds that do not heal or have exuberant scar tissue are indicated for evidence of squamous cell carcinoma. Suggested regular testing includes screening for anemia and deficiencies of iron, zinc, vitamin D, selenium, and carnitine every 6-12 months. Yearly echocardiograms to identify dilated cardiomyopathy and bone mineral density studies to identify osteoporosis are recommended. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Poorly fitting or coarse-textured clothing and footwear; activities/bandages that traumatize the skin. Evaluation of relatives at risk: Evaluating an at-risk newborn for evidence of blistering is appropriate so that trauma to the skin can be avoided as much as possible. Genetic counseling Dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa is inherited in either an autosomal dominant (DDEB) or autosomal recessive (RDEB) manner. Molecular characterization of pathogenic variants is the only accurate method to determine mode of inheritance and recurrence risk; phenotype severity and IF/EM findings alone are not sufficient. DDEB. About 70% of individuals diagnosed with DDEB are reported to have an affected parent. If a parent of a proband with DDEB is affected, the risk to the sibs is 50%. Each child of an individual with DDEB has a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant. RDEB. Each sib of an affected individual whose parents are both carriers has at conception a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Once the COL7A1 pathogenic variant(s) have been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.

Blistering may be severe and granulation tissue can form on the skin around the oral and nasal cavities, fingers and toes, and internally around the upper airway. Blisters generally heal with no significant scarring. Broad classification of JEB includes JEB generalized severe and JEB generalized intermediate. In JEB generalized severe, blisters are present at birth or become apparent in the neonatal period. Congenital malformations of the urinary tract and bladder may also occur. In JEB generalized intermediate, the phenotype may be mild with blistering localized to hands, feet, knees, and elbows with or without renal or ureteral involvement.

EBS is distinguished from other types of epidermolysis bullosa (EB) or non-EB skin fragility syndromes by the location of the blistering in relation to the dermal-epidermal junction. In EBS, blistering occurs within basal keratinocytes. The severity of blistering ranges from limited to hands and feet to widespread involvement. Additional features can include hyperkeratosis of the palms and soles (keratoderma), nail dystrophy, milia, and hyper- and/or hypopigmentation. Rare EBS subtypes have been associated with additional clinical features including pyloric atresia, muscular dystrophy, cardiomyopathy, and/or nephropathy. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of EBS is established in a proband by: the identification of a heterozygous dominant-negative variant or biallelic loss-of-function variants in KRT5, KRT14, or PLEC; a heterozygous pathogenic variant in KLHL24; or biallelic pathogenic variants in CD151, DST, or EXPH5; and/or presence of characteristic findings on examination of a skin biopsy using transmission electron microscopy and/or immunofluorescent mapping. Management Treatment of manifestations: Supportive care to protect the skin from blistering; use of dressings that will protect the skin and promote healing of wounds. Encourage activities that minimize trauma to the skin; appropriate footwear and physical therapy to preserve ambulation; lance and drain without unroofing new blisters. Dressings consist of three layers: a primary nonadherent contact layer; a secondary layer that provides stability, adds padding, and absorbs drainage; and a tertiary layer with elastic properties. Aluminum chloride (20%) applied to palms and soles can reduce sweating and therefore minimize blister formation in some individuals with EBS. In addition, botulinum toxin, cyproheptadine (Periactin), tetracycline, erythromycin, diacerein, sirolimus, apremilast, cannabidiol oil, and gentamicin have all been reported to be beneficial.

Autosomal recessive EBS is associated with either biallelic loss-of-function variants in KRT5, KRT14, or PLEC or biallelic pathogenic variants in CD151, DST, or EXPH5. Autosomal dominant EBS is associated with either a heterozygous dominant-negative variant in KRT5, KRT14, or PLEC or a heterozygous pathogenic variant in KLHL24. In rare instances, EBS is caused by the presence of heterozygous pathogenic variants in both KRT5 and KRT14 and is inherited in a digenic manner. Autosomal recessive EBS.

Autosomal dominant EBS. In families with autosomal dominant inheritance, each child of an affected individual has a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant and (most likely) being affected with EBS (penetrance appears to be <100% for known heterozygous dominant-negative KRT5 and KRT14 variants).

Onset of articular pain is variable but usually occurs in late childhood. Stature is usually within the normal range prior to puberty; in adulthood, stature is only slightly diminished and ranges from 150 to 180 cm. Functional disability is mild. Diagnosis/testing Diagnosis of SLC26A2-MED is based on detection of biallelic variants in SLC26A2 by molecular genetic testing in an individual with compatible clinical and radiographic findings. Management Treatment of manifestations: Physiotherapy for muscular strengthening and maintaining mobility; cautious use of analgesic medications such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; orthopedic surgery (joint replacement) as indicated; career counseling. Prevention of secondary complications: Intensive physiotherapy may help in delaying joint contractures and maintaining mobility. Surveillance: Radiographs as indicated. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Sports involving joint overload.

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD) is characterized by the clinical triad of: joint contractures that begin in early childhood; slowly progressive muscle weakness and wasting initially in a humero-peroneal distribution that later extends to the scapular and pelvic girdle muscles; and cardiac involvement that may manifest as palpitations, presyncope and syncope, poor exercise tolerance, and congestive heart failure along with variable cardiac rhythm disturbances. Age of onset, severity, and progression of muscle and cardiac involvement demonstrate both inter- and intrafamilial variability. Clinical variability ranges from early onset with severe presentation in childhood to late onset with slow progression in adulthood. In general, joint contractures appear during the first two decades, followed by muscle weakness and wasting. Cardiac involvement usually occurs after the second decade and respiratory function may be impaired in some individuals. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of EDMD is established in a proband with: A clearly relevant clinical picture including limb muscle wasting and/or weakness and elbow or neck/spine joint contractures (cardiac disease may be missing in the first decades of life); AND A hemizygous pathogenic variant in EMD or FHL1, a heterozygous pathogenic variant in LMNA, or (more rarely) biallelic pathogenic variants in LMNA identified by molecular genetic testing.

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Periodontal Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (pEDS) is characterized by distinct oral manifestations. Periodontal tissue breakdown beginning in the teens results in premature loss of teeth. Lack of attached gingiva and thin and fragile gums lead to gingival recession. Connective tissue abnormalities of pEDS typically include easy bruising, pretibial plaques, distal joint hypermobility, hoarse voice, and less commonly manifestations such as organ or vessel rupture. Since the first descriptions of pEDS in the 1970s, 148 individuals have been reported in the literature; however, future in-depth descriptions of non-oral manifestations in newly diagnosed individuals with a molecularly confirmed diagnosis of pEDS will be important to further define the clinical features. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of pEDS is established in a proband with suggestive clinical findings and a heterozygous pathogenic gain-of-function variant in either C1R or C1S identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Treatment is individualized based on the clinical manifestations present. Due to the characteristic features of early and severe periodontitis, all individuals should be regularly seen by a periodontist beginning in early childhood. Excellent oral hygiene is also a major element of the treatment of existing periodontitis. Prosthetic rehabilitation after tooth loss is challenging as most of the alveolar bone is destroyed. Joint hypermobility may benefit from physiotherapy, occupational therapy, pain management, and appropriate exercise.

GeneReviews Surveillance: Due to high risk of progression of the periodontal disease, supportive periodontal care including reevaluation of periodontal parameters, oral hygiene instructions (e.g., use of interdental cleaning devices and electric toothbrushes), and supra- and sub-gingival debridement is recommended every three to six months, according to the needs of the individual. Complications of joint hypermobility addressed by consultant rheumatologist, physical therapist, and occupational therapist as needed. Evaluation of relatives at risk: It is appropriate to clarify the genetic status of apparently asymptomatic older and younger at-risk relatives of an affected individual in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from prompt initiation of preventive dental hygiene and routine dental care and surveillance. Genetic counseling Periodontal EDS is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Most individuals with pEDS have the disorder as the result of a C1R or C1S pathogenic variant inherited from an affected parent. Each child of an affected individual has a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant and developing the disorder.

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Classic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (cEDS) is a heritable connective tissue disorder characterized by skin hyperextensibility, atrophic scarring, and generalized joint hypermobility (GJH). The skin is soft, velvety, or doughy to the touch. In addition, the skin is hyperextensible, meaning that it extends easily and snaps back after release. The skin is fragile, as manifested by splitting of the dermis following relatively minor trauma, especially over pressure points (knees, elbows) and areas prone to trauma (shins, forehead, chin). Wound healing is poor, and stretching, thinning, and pigmentation of scars is characteristic, leading to the presence of atrophic and/or hemosiderotic scars. Easy bruising is also a hallmark of cEDS. GJH is present in most but not all affected individuals, evidenced by the presence of a Beighton score of five or greater, either on examination or historically. Joint instability complications may comprise sprains and dislocations/subluxations. Mild muscle hypotonia with delayed motor development, fatigue and muscle cramps, and some skeletal morphologic alterations (scoliosis, pectus deformities, genus/hallux valgus, pes planus) are regularly observed. While aortic root dilatation and mitral valve prolapse are seen in cEDS, they are rarely clinically significant. Arterial aneurysm and rupture have been reported in a few individuals with cEDS. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of cEDS is established in a proband with characteristic clinical features and a heterozygous pathogenic variant in COL1A1, COL5A1, or COL5A2 identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Dermal wounds are closed without tension, preferably in two layers. For other wounds, deep stitches are applied generously; cutaneous stitches are left in place twice as long as usual; and the borders of adjacent skin are carefully taped to prevent stretching of the scar. Young children with skin fragility can wear pads or bandages over the forehead, knees, and shins to avoid skin tears.

Subluxations, dislocations, and soft tissue injury are common; they may occur spontaneously or with minimal trauma and can be acutely painful. Degenerative joint and chronic soft tissue disorders may arise due to repeated injury. Chronic pain, distinct from that associated with acute injury, is common and often neuropathic in nature. Chronic fatigue, functional bowel disorders, cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction, swallow and phonation disorders, sleep disorders including apnea, migraine, entrapment and peripheral neuropathies, inflammation from mast cell activation disorders, anxiety disorders, and urogynecologic disorders are common. Mitral valve prolapse and aortic root dilatation, when present, are typically of a mild degree with no increased risk of cardiac complications. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of hEDS is established in an adult proband based on 2017 international clinical diagnostic criteria. Currently, no underlying genetic, epigenetic, or metabolomic etiology has been identified for hEDS. Management Treatment of manifestations: Tailored treatment with exercise to increase core and extremity muscle strength and tone, proprioception, and joint stability; braces and splints to improve alignment and control; occupational therapy for assistive devices (e.g., wide-grip writing utensils, home and work ergonomics); physical therapy for assistive devices (e.g., wheelchair or scooter, suitable mattress, soft neck collar); pain management tailored to cause and symptoms; platelet disorders may respond to tranexamic or mefenamic acid; nutrition advice for micronutrient deficiencies; gastritis, gastroparesis, and gastroesophageal reflux disease may require intensive pharmacotherapy; therapies for other gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, ocular, neurologic, and urogynecologic Author Affiliation: 1 The Harley Street Clinic, HCA Healthcare, London UK; Email: alan.hakim@ehlers-danlos.com.

Surveillance: Assess for joint manifestations, pain, disability, bleeding issues, functional bowel disorders, autonomic dysfunction, oral health needs, phonation and respiratory issues, sleep issues, vision issues, headaches and other neurologic manifestations, inflammatory disease, neurobehavioral and psychiatric manifestations, and urogynecologic manifestations annually or at each visit. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry in those with height loss greater than one inch, atypical/low trauma fractures, or radiographs suggestive of osteopenia.

Chiropractic adjustment and yoga are not contraindicated but like all other physical treatments must be performed in ways that avoid iatrogenic subluxations or dislocations. Autonomic concerns, gastrointestinal disorders, and intolerances may preclude use of medications or their excipients (e.g., common analgesics in someone with slow gastrointestinal transit, vasodilator in a person with orthostatic intolerance). Pregnancy management: Preconceptual (e.g., musculoskeletal health and medication use), antenatal (e.g., joint instability, pelvic strength, hernias, and pain management), intrapartum (e.g., birth choices, mobility in labor, anesthesia), and postpartum (e.g., wound healing, pelvic health, newborn/infant care) issues should all be addressed. Genetic counseling Hypermobile EDS is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner with variable expression of signs and variable severity of symptoms among affected family members. Most individuals diagnosed with hEDS have an affected parent, although a detailed history and examination of the parents is often necessary to recognize that a parent has a current or prior history of joint laxity, easy bruising, and skin manifestations despite the absence of serious complications. Each child of an individual with hEDS has a 50% chance of inheriting hEDS. Because the gene(s) and pathogenic variant(s) responsible for hEDS have not been identified, prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing are not possible."

Vascular dissection or rupture, gastrointestinal perforation, or organ rupture are the presenting signs in most adults with vEDS. Arterial rupture may be preceded by aneurysm, arteriovenous fistulae, or dissection but also may occur spontaneously. The majority (60%) of individuals with vEDS who are diagnosed before age 18 years are identified because of a positive family history. Neonates may present with clubfoot, hip dislocation, limb deficiency, and/or amniotic bands. Approximately half of children tested for vEDS in the absence of a positive family history present with a major complication at an average age of 11 years. Four minor diagnostic features distal joint hypermobility, easy bruising, thin skin, and clubfeet are most often present in those children ascertained without a major complication. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of vEDS is established in a proband by identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in COL3A1, or, when molecular genetic testing does not identify a COL3A1 pathogenic variant, on biochemical analysis of type III procollagen from cultured fibroblasts. Management Treatment of manifestations: Affected individuals are instructed to seek immediate medical attention for sudden, unexplained pain. Treatment may include medical or surgical management for arterial complications, bowel rupture, or uterine rupture during pregnancy. Surveillance: May include periodic arterial screening by ultrasound examination, magnetic resonance angiogram, or computed tomography angiogram with and without venous contrast. Blood pressure monitoring on a regular basis is recommended to allow for early treatment if hypertension develops.

Evaluation of relatives at risk: The genetic status of at-risk relatives should be clarified through molecular genetic testing or clinical evaluation if the pathogenic variant is unknown. Pregnancy management: Affected women have a 5% mortality risk with each pregnancy. The issue of management and recommendations is complicated by the recognition that many of the women who became pregnant, and their providers, learn of the diagnosis at the time of delivery and the onset of complications.

Infants sometimes have frequent vomiting and loss of social interaction. Speech is delayed and in some instances absent. Swallowing difficulties and failure to thrive are common. Children may be unable to walk without support and may be wheelchair bound. Neurologic deterioration accelerates following intercurrent infectious illness, and the majority of children die in the first decade. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of EE is suggested by clinical findings and the laboratory findings of increased blood lactate levels, C4- and C5-acylcarnitine esters, plasma thiosulphate, and urinary ethylmalonic acid. The diagnosis is established by identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in ETHE1 on molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Multi-specialty care that includes child neurology, pediatrics, clinical genetics, nutrition, gastroenterology, pain management, and physical therapy can help with timely detection and treatment of the multiorgan dysfunction that characterizes EE.

Other common findings are joint hyperlaxity in infancy and increasing risk of inguinal hernia at all ages. Progressive findings that may be present as early as childhood include ptosis, aortic root dilatation, and emphysema. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of ELN-related cutis laxa is established in a proband with suggestive findings and a heterozygous pathogenic (or likely pathogenic) variant in ELN identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: There is no cure for ELN-related cutis laxa. Experience in treating individuals with ELN-related cutis laxa is very limited. Supportive care to improve quality of life, maximize function, and reduce complications is recommended and ideally involves multidisciplinary care by specialists in general surgery, cardiothoracic surgery, cardiology, pulmonology, urology, physical therapy, ophthalmology, and medical genetics. Surveillance: Monitor for known problems (e.g., inguinal hernias, joint hypermobility and pain) and new issues that may require interventions (e.g., ptosis, aortic root dilatation, emphysema, bladder diverticula). Agents/circumstances to avoid: Positive pressure ventilation unless needed for life-threatening conditions; contact with people with respiratory infections; tobacco smoking; isometric exercise (which causes an increase in blood pressure); contact sports or activities that increase the risk for blunt abdominal trauma and/or joint injury or pain; sunbathing or tanning in order to preserve residual skin elasticity.

GeneReviews Pregnancy management: Perinatal complications for mothers with ELN-related cutis laxa or affected neonates have not been reported to date. Nonetheless, recommended evaluations for women with ELN-related cutis laxa before conception and during pregnancy are pulmonary function testing and cardiovascular assessment (including aortic root diameter). Continued cardiac surveillance for six months post partum is also recommended. Additionally, women taking a beta-blocker should continue it during pregnancy; however, some other classes of medications, such as angiotensin receptor-blocking agents, are teratogenic and should be discontinued or changed to beta-blocking agents, given the increased risk for teratogenicity typically related to second- and third-trimester exposure. Genetic counseling ELN-related cutis laxa is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. About one third of individuals diagnosed with ELN-related cutis laxa have an affected parent; about two thirds of affected individuals have the disorder as the result of a de novo ELN pathogenic variant. Each child of an individual with ELN-related cutis laxa has a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant. Once the ELN pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing are possible."

EPB42-HS can present with jaundice as early as the first 24 hours of life or can present later in childhood with anemia resulting from a hemolytic crisis or aplastic crisis (usually associated with a viral infection). In addition to the hematologic manifestations, serious complications include splenomegaly, which can become evident in early childhood, and cholelithiasis, which usually becomes evident in the second or third decade of life. Typical laboratory findings in EPB42-HS include anemia (decreased hemoglobin [Hgb] level) and reticulocytosis (increased percentage of reticulocytes), with high mean corpuscular Hgb concentration, presence of spherocytes in the peripheral blood smear, significantly decreased or absent haptoglobin, mildly increased osmotic fragility in osmotic fragility assay, increased Omin (osmolality at which 50% of red blood cells hemolyze), and decreased maximal elongation index (EImax) in osmotic gradient ektacytometry. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of EPB42-HS is established by identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in EPB42. Management Treatment of manifestations: Treatment of hyperbilirubinemia as needed; folic acid supplementation; red blood cell transfusion as needed for a hemolytic or aplastic crisis; routine immunizations; iron chelation therapy as needed. Prior to splenectomy, immunizations for S pneumoniae, N meningitidis, and H influenzae. Although splenectomy is rarely indicated in EPB42-HS because disease severity is usually mild or moderate, partial or total splenectomy may be recommended in those with moderately severe EPB42-HS who are older than age five years when quality of life is compromised. Following splenectomy, booster immunizations for S pneumoniae and N meningitidis, prophylactic antibiotics, and prompt antibiotics for fever are recommended.

GeneReviews those with signs and/or symptoms of cholelithiasis; affected individuals with a history of cholelithiasis should have cholecystectomy at the time of splenectomy. Surveillance: Monitor serum bilirubin concentration in neonates during the first week of life and Hgb in infants during the first two to four months of life. Those dependent on frequent transfusions and those receiving iron chelation therapy require monitoring of serum ferritin concentration. Monitor efficacy of chelation via T2*- weighted liver MRI and adjust appropriately. Abdominal ultrasound examination to evaluate for cholelithiasis either when symptoms are present or, when hemolysis is significant, every five to ten years beginning at age ten to 12 years. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Avoid supplements containing iron unless iron studies have documented iron deficiency.

Avoidance of contact sports is recommended in those with splenomegaly; of note, acute or excessive splenomegaly is a greater risk than chronic mild splenomegaly. Evaluation of relatives at risk: When EPB42-HS has been diagnosed in a family member, the following is recommended for at-risk sibs: (1) Neonates at risk require monitoring of serum bilirubin concentration during the first week of life so that treatment for hyperbilirubinemia can be instituted promptly; (2) Infants at risk require monitoring in the first two to four months of life for significant anemia, which may require red blood cell transfusion and initiation of folic acid supplementation. Laboratory evaluation (CBC and reticulocyte count, blood smear, osmotic fragility or ektacytometry) and/or molecular genetic testing for the EPB42 pathogenic variants in the family (if known) is appropriate for at-risk relatives.

At the most severe end of the spectrum is classic Vici syndrome (defined as a neurodevelopmental disorder with multisystem involvement characterized by the combination of agenesis of the corpus callosum, cataracts, hypopigmentation, cardiomyopathy, combined immunodeficiency, microcephaly, and failure to thrive); at the milder end of the spectrum are attenuated neurodevelopmental phenotypes with variable multisystem involvement. Median survival in classic Vici syndrome appears to be 24 months, with only 10% of children surviving longer than age five years; the most common causes of death are respiratory infections as a result of primary immunodeficiency and/or cardiac insufficiency resulting from progressive cardiac failure.

Symptoms (which may seem out of proportion to the visible skin lesions) may persist for hours or days after the initial phototoxic reaction. Photosensitivity remains for life. Multiple episodes of acute photosensitivity may lead to chronic changes of sun- exposed skin (lichenification, leathery pseudovesicles, grooving around the lips) and loss of lunulae of the nails. Approximately 20%-30% of individuals with EPP have some degree of liver dysfunction, which is typically mild with slight elevations of the liver enzymes. Up to 5% may develop more advanced liver disease which may be accompanied by motor neuropathy similar to that seen in the acute porphyrias.

SCN9A-EM is characterized by recurrent episodes of bilateral intense, burning pain, and redness, warmth, and occasionally swelling. While the feet are more commonly affected than the hands, in severely affected individuals the legs, arms, face, and/or ears may be involved. SCN9A-PEPD is characterized by neonatal or infantile onset of autonomic manifestations that can include skin flushing, harlequin (patchy or asymmetric) color change, tonic non-epileptic attacks (stiffening), and syncope with bradycardia. Later manifestations are episodes of excruciating deep burning rectal, ocular, or submandibular pain accompanied by flushing (erythematous skin changes). SCN9A-SFN is characterized by adult-onset neuropathic pain in a stocking and glove distribution, often with a burning quality; autonomic manifestations such as dry eyes, mouth, orthostatic dizziness, palpitations, bowel or bladder disturbances; and preservation of large nerve fiber functions (normal strength, tendon reflexes, and vibration sense).

Lacosamide is associated with reduced pain ratings, improved general well-being and sleep quality, but not with changed overall quality of life or autonomic manifestations. Surveillance: Follow up with a neurologist or neuromuscular specialist to assess for disease progression. Routine monitoring for side effects of medications used in treatment (such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome, liver toxicity, neutropenia seen with carbamazepine). Agents/circumstances to avoid: Triggers including warmth, standing, alcohol, and spicy foods (SCN9A-EM); defecation, cold wind, eating, and emotion (SCN9A-PEPD); diabetes mellitus, alcohol, and chemotherapy (SCN9A SFN). Evaluation of relatives at risk: It is appropriate to clarify the genetic status of apparently asymptomatic older and younger relatives of an affected individual at risk for SCN9A-NPS in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from avoidance of activities that are known to trigger onset of pain. Pregnancy management: Potential teratogenic effects of medications used for treatment of SCN9A-NPS should be discussed with affected women of childbearing age, ideally prior to conception. Genetic counseling SCN9A neuropathic pain syndromes are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner.

Osteochondromas can be associated with a reduction in skeletal growth, bony deformity, restricted joint motion, shortened stature, premature osteoarthrosis, and compression of peripheral nerves. The median age of diagnosis is three years; nearly all affected individuals are diagnosed by age 12 years. The risk for malignant degeneration to osteochondrosarcoma increases with age, although the lifetime risk for malignant degeneration is low (~2%-5%).

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Fabry disease is the most common of the lysosomal storage disorders and results from deficient activity of the enzyme alpha-galactosidase A (-Gal A), leading to progressive lysosomal deposition of globotriaosylceramide and its derivatives in cells throughout the body. The classic form, occurring in males with less than 1% -Gal A enzyme activity, usually has its onset in childhood or adolescence with periodic crises of severe pain in the extremities (acroparesthesia), the appearance of vascular cutaneous lesions (angiokeratomas), sweating abnormalities (anhidrosis, hypohidrosis, and rarely hyperhidrosis), characteristic corneal and lenticular opacities, and proteinuria. Gradual deterioration of kidney function to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) usually occurs in men in the third to fifth decade. In middle age, most males successfully treated for ESKD develop cardiac and/or cerebrovascular disease, a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Heterozygous females typically have milder symptoms at a later age of onset than males. Rarely, females may be relatively asymptomatic throughout a normal life span or may have symptoms as severe as those observed in males with the classic phenotype. In contrast, late-onset forms occur in males with greater than 1% -Gal A activity. Clinical manifestations include cardiac disease, which usually presents in the sixth to eighth decade with left ventricular hypertrophy, cardiomyopathy, arrhythmia, and proteinuria; kidney failure, associated with ESKD but without the skin lesions or pain; or cerebrovascular disease presenting as stroke or transient ischemic attack. Diagnosis/testing Identification of deficient -Gal A enzyme activity in plasma, isolated leukocytes, and/or cultured cells is the most efficient and reliable method of diagnosing Fabry disease in males.

GeneReviews heterozygous GLA pathogenic variant by molecular genetic testing establishes the diagnosis in a heterozygous female. Management Targeted therapies: Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with or without chaperone therapy (e.g., migalastat) to prevent and/or delay the progression of renal, cardiac, and cerebrovascular manifestations. Experts recommend that ERT be initiated as early as possible in all males with Fabry disease (including children and those with ESKD undergoing dialysis and kidney transplantation) and in females with clinical disease manifestations, as all are at high risk for renal, cardiac, and cerebrovascular complications. Supportive care: Diphenylhydantoin, carbamazepine, or gabapentin to reduce pain (acroparesthesia); aspirin, lipid-lowering agents, and blood pressure control for cardiac ischemia; aspirin and/or other antiplatelet agents may be recommended for stroke prophylaxis; ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers to reduce proteinuria; chronic hemodialysis and/or kidney transplantation for ESKD; rehabilitation and hearing aids for auditory and vestibular symptoms; management of psychiatric manifestations per psychologist. Surveillance: Annual assessment for angiokeratomas, acroparesthesia, sweating abnormalities, and gastrointestinal, pulmonary, and vascular manifestations; annual cardiology assessment with EKG and echocardiogram as recommended by cardiologist from age 18 years in males, biannual cardiology assessments in females from age 18 years; annual neurologic assessment with brain MRI\\\\MRA every two to three years beginning at age 18 years; assessment of renal function including blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and urinalysis annually or more frequently as needed; annual audiology evaluations in males beginning at age 18 years and biannually in females; psychological assessment beginning at age 18 years annually or more frequently as needed. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Smoking. Amiodarone may or may not have detrimental effects in individuals with Fabry disease; evidence is insufficient. Evaluation of relatives at risk: Early identification of affected male and female relatives by molecular genetic testing (if the GLA pathogenic variant in the family is known) or, in males only, measurement of -Gal A enzyme activity (if the GLA pathogenic variant in the family is not known) in order to initiate appropriate management as early as possible in affected individuals. Genetic counseling Fabry disease is inherited in an X-linked manner: hemizygous males are affected; heterozygous females may be as severely affected as males or asymptomatic throughout a normal life span. In a family with more than one affected individual, the mother of an affected male is an obligate heterozygote. If a male is the only affected family member, his mother is likely heterozygous for the GLA pathogenic variant; rarely, a single affected male in a family may have a de novo pathogenic variant. A heterozygous female has a 50% chance of transmitting the GLA pathogenic variant in each pregnancy. An affected male transmits the pathogenic variant to all his daughters and none of his sons. Once the GLA pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, molecular genetic testing for at-risk relatives, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk, and preimplantation genetic testing are possible."

Thrombosis in unusual locations is less common. Factors that predispose to VTE in factor V Leiden thrombophilia include: the number of factor V Leiden variant alleles (homozygotes have a much greater thrombotic risk); family history of VTE; presence of coexisting genetic thrombophilic disorders; acquired thrombophilic disorders (e.g., antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, myeloproliferative disorders); and circumstantial risk factors (e.g., pregnancy, malignancy, central venous catheters, travel, combined oral contraceptive use and other combined contraceptives, oral hormone replacement therapy [HRT], obesity, leg injury, and advancing age). Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of factor V Leiden thrombophilia is established in a proband by identification of a heterozygous or homozygous c.1601G>A (p.Arg534Gln) variant in F5 on molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: The first acute venous thrombosis is treated according to current guidelines. The duration of oral anticoagulation therapy should be based on an assessment of the risks for VTE recurrence and anticoagulant-related bleeding. Prevention of primary manifestations: In the absence of a history of thrombosis, long-term prophylactic anticoagulation is not routinely recommended for asymptomatic factor V Leiden variant heterozygotes. A short course of prophylactic anticoagulation when transient risk factors are present may prevent initial thrombosis in heterozygotes.

GeneReviews Surveillance: Periodic reevaluation of individuals on long-term anticoagulation to confirm that the benefits of anticoagulation continue to outweigh the risk of bleeding. Factor V Leiden heterozygotes who do not require long-term anticoagulation may benefit from evaluation prior to exposure to circumstantial risk factors such as surgery or pregnancy. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Women with a history of VTE who are heterozygous for the factor V Leiden variant and women homozygous for the factor V Leiden variant with or without prior VTE should avoid estrogen-containing contraception and HRT. Women electing use of oral contraceptives should avoid third- generation and other progestins with a higher thrombotic risk. Women electing use of short-term HRT for severe menopausal symptoms should avoid oral formulations. Evaluation of relatives at risk: The indications for testing of at-risk family members are unresolved. In the absence of evidence that early identification of the factor V Leiden variant leads to interventions that can reduce morbidity or mortality, decisions regarding testing should be made on an individual basis. Pregnancy management: Women with thrombophilia should undergo individualized risk assessment. In women heterozygous for the factor V Leiden variant, antepartum prophylactic anticoagulation is not recommended for prevention of the first VTE. In homozygous and double heterozygous women (factor V Leiden and F2 20210G>A variants), antepartum and postpartum prophylactic anticoagulation is suggested to prevent a first VTE. Genetic counseling Factor V Leiden thrombophilia is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Individuals who are heterozygous for the factor V Leiden variant have a slightly increased risk for VTE; individuals who are homozygous for the factor V Leiden variant have a much greater thrombotic risk. Many individuals with the factor V Leiden variant never develop thrombosis. Most individuals with factor V Leiden thrombophilia are heterozygous for the factor V Leiden variant, which they inherited from a parent who is also heterozygous for the factor V Leiden variant. Each child of a heterozygous proband has a 50% chance of inheriting the factor V Leiden variant from the proband; if the proband's reproductive partner is also heterozygous for the factor V Leiden variant, each of their children has a 25% chance of being homozygous for the factor V Leiden variant, a 50% chance of being heterozygous, and a 25% chance of being neither heterozygous nor homozygous for the factor V Leiden variant."

FAP is a colorectal cancer (CRC) predisposition syndrome that can manifest in either classic or attenuated form. Classic FAP is characterized by hundreds to thousands of adenomatous colonic polyps, beginning on average at age 16 years (range 7-36 years). For those with the classic form of FAP, 95% of individuals have polyps by age 35 years; CRC is inevitable without colectomy. The mean age of CRC diagnosis in untreated individuals is 39 years (range 34-43 years). The attenuated form is characterized by multiple colonic polyps (average of 30), more proximally located polyps, and a diagnosis of CRC at a later age than in classic FAP. For those with an attenuated form, there is a 70% lifetime risk of CRC and the mean age of diagnosis is 50-55 years. Extracolonic manifestations are variably present and include polyps of the stomach and duodenum, osteomas, dental abnormalities, congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium (CHRPE), benign cutaneous lesions, desmoid tumors, adrenal masses, and other associated cancers.

Management GeneReviews Treatment of manifestations: Resection of all colonic polyps larger than 5 mm found on colonic surveillance. There is an absolute indication for colectomy when CRC is diagnosed or suspected, or when there are significant symptoms (e.g., bleeding, obstruction). Relative indications for colectomy include presence of multiple adenomas larger than 10 mm that cannot be reasonably removed endoscopically, a significant increase in adenoma number between surveillance exams, presence of adenomas with high-grade dysplasia, or inability to adequately survey the colon (e.g., due to innumerable diminutive adenomas or limited access to or compliance with colonoscopy). Endoscopic or surgical removal of duodenal adenomas is considered if polyps exhibit villous change or severe dysplasia, exceed 1 cm in diameter, or exhibit advanced stage using Spigelman scoring system. Gastrectomy is considered if advanced gastric neoplasia is found on upper endoscopy. Osteomas may be removed for cosmetic reasons. Desmoid tumors may be surgically excised or treated with nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), anti-estrogens, cytotoxic chemotherapy, and/or radiation if at advanced stage. Standard treatment when needed for adrenal masses and thyroid carcinoma. Several studies have shown that NSAIDs and erlotinib have caused regression of adenomas and decreased the polyp burden in individuals with FAP, though there are currently no FDA-approved chemopreventive agents for FAP, given an unclear effect on subsequent cancer risk. Prevention of primary manifestations: Colectomy to reduce the risk for CRC in individuals with classic FAP. For individuals with attenuated FAP, colectomy may be necessary, but in approximately one third of individuals, the colonic polyps are limited enough in number that surveillance with periodic colonoscopic polypectomy is sufficient to prevent CRC. It is currently unknown if prophylactic gastrectomy should be considered in individuals with GAPPS. Surveillance: Colorectal screening by colonoscopy every one to two years beginning at age ten to 15 years for classic FAP and in late adolescence for attenuated FAP; esophagogastroduodenoscopy with visualization of the ampulla of Vater by age 20 to 25 years or prior to colon surgery, with consideration of complete small bowel visualization in the setting of advanced Spigelman stage. Annual thyroid palpation, thyroid ultrasound, neurologic examination, and abdominal examination (for desmoids). Liver palpation, liver ultrasound, and measurement of serum alpha-fetoprotein every three to six months until age five years for hepatoblastoma. The efficacy of screening for gastric cancer in individuals with GAPPS is currently unknown. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Multistage surgeries in those at high risk for desmoids; total colectomy with ileal pouch anal anastomosis in women prior to childbearing. Evaluation of relatives at risk: Molecular genetic testing for early identification of at-risk family members improves diagnostic certainty and reduces the need for costly screening procedures in those at-risk family members who have not inherited the pathogenic variant. Genetic counseling APC-associated polyposis conditions are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Approximately 75%-80% of individuals with an APC-associated polyposis condition have an affected parent. Offspring of an affected individual are at a 50% risk of inheriting the pathogenic variant in APC. Prenatal testing and preimplantation genetic testing are possible if a pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member. Polyposis Conditions 3"

Clinical characteristics Autosomal dominant familial exudative vitreoretinopathy (adFEVR) is characterized by failure of peripheral retinal vascularization. The visual problems and variable phenotype associated with adFEVR result from secondary complications caused by retinal ischemia. The retinal avascularity is probably present from birth and generates sequelae that stabilize in early adult life or progress in later life. Expressivity may be asymmetric and is highly variable, ranging from mild or asymptomatic to severe (e.g., registered as blind) within the same family. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of adFEVR is based on a family history compatible with autosomal dominant inheritance and bilateral peripheral retinal avascularity, seen temporally, by indirect ophthalmoscope and scleral indentation, or by fundus fluorescein angiography. Pathogenic variants in one of three genes are known to be associated with adFEVR: FZD4, encoding the protein frizzled-4; LRP5, encoding low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5; and TSPAN12, encoding tetraspanin-12. Pathogenic variants in these genes are responsible for fewer than 50% of adFEVR cases. Another locus, EVR3, has been mapped; the gene is not known.

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics GAA-FGF14-related ataxia is a mid to late adult-onset slowly progressive cerebellar syndrome with predominant gait involvement. Median age at onset is 60 years (range: 21-87 years). Nearly 50% of individuals may first experience episodic manifestations including gait and limb ataxia, visual disturbances (diplopia, oscillopsia, and blurring), vertigo and/or dizziness, or dysarthria on average two to four years before the onset of progressive ataxia. Episodic symptoms may persist after the onset of progressive ataxia and may be triggered by alcohol intake and physical activity. Although some individuals eventually require assistance with mobility, use of a wheelchair is less necessary than in other common hereditary spinocerebellar ataxias (e.g., SCA1, SCA2, and SCA3). Dysarthria does not develop in all individuals and often remains mild to moderate. Cerebellar oculomotor signs, including downbeat nystagmus, horizontal gaze-evoked nystagmus, and impaired visual fixation suppression of the vestibuloocular reflex, are common. Unilateral or bilateral vestibular hypofunction and tremor of the upper limbs may occur. Age of onset and clinical presentation can vary within the same family.

Copyright 1993-2024, University of Washington, Seattle. GeneReviews is a registered trademark of the University of Washington, Seattle. All rights reserved. Diagnosis/testing GeneReviews The diagnosis of GAA-FGF14-related ataxia is established in a symptomatic individual with a compatible phenotype by the identification of a heterozygous (GAA)>300 repeat expansion in intron 1 of FGF14 by molecular genetic testing. Due to reduced penetrance of FGF14 (GAA)250-300 repeat expansions, the diagnosis of GAA-FGF14-related ataxia can also be established in symptomatic individuals with a (GAA)250-300 repeat expansion if their phenotype is compatible, other inherited causes of ataxia have been excluded, and, if possible, familial segregation with the disease is confirmed. Individuals whose phenotype differs significantly from GAA- FGF14-related ataxia should be screened for other causes of inherited ataxias. Management Treatment of manifestations: There is no cure for GAA-FGF14-related ataxia. The goals of treatment are to improve quality of life, maximize function, and reduce complications. This ideally involves multidisciplinary care by specialists in relevant fields, such as neurologists, ophthalmologists, orthoptists, physical therapists, occupational therapists, speech-language therapists, and psychologists. Preliminary studies have shown promising symptomatic benefits of 4-aminopyridine for ataxic symptoms and downbeat nystagmus. Surveillance: To monitor existing manifestations, the individual's response to supportive care, and the emergence of new manifestations, regularly scheduled follow up by the treating specialists is recommended. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Inform affected individuals that alcohol intake and strenuous physical activity may precipitate episodes of ataxia and may exacerbate incoordination. Avoid medications with known toxicity to the cerebellum and the vestibular system. Genetic counseling GAA-FGF14-related ataxia is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Most individuals diagnosed with GAA-FGF14-related ataxia inherit an abnormal GAA repeat expansion from a parent who has a high normal- size or likely pathogenic or pathogenic GAA repeat expansion (a parent with an abnormal GAA repeat expansion may or may not have manifestations of GAA-FGF14-related ataxia). Each child of an individual with GAA-FGF14-related ataxia has a 50% chance of inheriting the GAA-FGF14-related allele. The likelihood that offspring who inherit the GAA-FGF14-related allele will have a GAA repeat size in the pathogenic, reduced penetrance, or non-pathogenic range is influenced by intergenerational instability; the size of the GAA repeat is more likely to expand upon maternal transmission and to contract upon paternal transmission. Once a GAA repeat expansion has been identified in an affected family member, predictive testing for at-risk relatives and prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing for GAA-FGF14-related ataxia are possible. However, accurate prediction of future possible clinical manifestations in a fetus found to have an FGF14 GAA repeat expansion is not possible, and the current lack of knowledge regarding somatic instability of the repeat prenatally makes the interpretation of prenatal genetic test results challenging."

Difficulties with temperament and behavior that are present in many children tend to improve in adulthood. Other features can include hyperopia and/or strabismus, conductive hearing loss, seizures, gastroesophageal reflux, renal anomalies (e.g., hydronephrosis / renal pelviectasis, cysts, and/or agenesis), and genital anomalies (e.g., hypospadias and/or undescended testes). Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis is established by identification of a heterozygous SRCAP pathogenic variant in those with clinical findings of FHS. Management Treatment of manifestations: Early intervention programs, special education, and vocational training to address developmental disabilities; communication rehabilitation with sign language or alternative means of communication; and behavior management by a behavioral specialist/psychologist with consideration of medication as needed. Referral to an endocrinologist for consideration of human growth hormone (HGH) therapy; however, data on use of HGH in FHS are limited.

Most affected children achieve independent walking between ages two and four years. A decline of motor function in adulthood may be seen, but affected individuals are likely to be able to participate in activities of daily living in adulthood and maintain independent walking. Occasional features underlying systemic connective tissue involvement include aortic rupture and arterial dissection, subdural hygroma, insufficiency of cardiac valves, bluish sclerae, bladder diverticula, inguinal or umbilical herniae, and premature rupture of membranes during pregnancy. Rarer findings may include bifid uvula with submucous or frank cleft palate, speech/language delay without true cognitive impairment, and rectal prolapse. Diagnosis/testing Clinical diagnostic criteria rely on the finding of congenital muscular hypotonia AND congenital or early-onset kyphoscoliosis in addition to generalized joint hypermobility or further gene-specific and/or supportive clinical features. The diagnosis of FKBP14-kEDS is established in a proband by the identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in FKBP14 by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: In those with aortic dilatation or vascular dissection, use of beta-blockers may be considered; physical and occupational therapy to address age-dependent decline in muscular strength; standard treatment for severe scoliosis, clubbed foot, osteopenia/osteoporosis, refractive error, hearing impairment, and cleft palate.

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics The FLNB disorders include a spectrum of phenotypes ranging from mild to severe. At the mild end are spondylocarpotarsal synostosis (SCT) syndrome and Larsen syndrome; at the severe end are the phenotypic continuum of atelosteogenesis types I (AOI) and III (AOIII) and Piepkorn osteochondrodysplasia (POCD). SCT syndrome is characterized by postnatal disproportionate short stature, scoliosis and lordosis, clubfeet, hearing loss, dental enamel hypoplasia, carpal and tarsal synostosis, and vertebral fusions. Larsen syndrome is characterized by congenital dislocations of the hip, knee, and elbow; clubfeet (equinovarus or equinovalgus foot deformities); scoliosis and cervical kyphosis, which can be associated with a cervical myelopathy; short, broad, spatulate distal phalanges; distinctive craniofacies (prominent forehead, depressed nasal bridge, malar flattening, and widely spaced eyes); vertebral anomalies; and supernumerary carpal and tarsal bone ossification centers. Individuals with SCT syndrome and Larsen syndrome can have midline cleft palate and hearing loss. AOI and AOIII are characterized by severe short-limbed dwarfism; dislocated hips, knees, and elbows; and clubfeet. AOI is lethal in the perinatal period. In individuals with AOIII, survival beyond the neonatal period is possible with intensive and invasive respiratory support. Piepkorn osteochondrodysplasia (POCD) is a perinatal-lethal micromelic dwarfism characterized by flipper-like limbs (polysyndactyly with complete syndactyly of all fingers and toes, hypoplastic or absent first digits, and duplicated intermediate and distal phalanges), macrobrachycephaly, prominant forehead, hypertelorism, and exophthalmos. Occasional features include cleft palate, omphalocele, and cardiac and genitourinary anomalies. The radiographic features at mid-gestation are characteristic.

Diagnosis/testing GeneReviews The diagnosis of SCT is established in a proband by identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in FLNB on molecular genetic testing. The diagnosis of other FLNB disorders (Larsen syndrome, AOI, AOIII, and Piepkorn osteochondrodysplasia) is established in a proband by identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in FLNB on molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Cervical spine instability in asymptomatic infants can be successfully managed with posterior arthrodesis. Function can be stabilized (if not improved) in infants with myelopathic signs by a combination of anterior decompression and circumferential arthrodesis. Hip dislocation in individuals with Larsen syndrome usually requires operative reduction. Scoliosis and clubfeet are managed in a routine manner. Anesthetic agents that exhibit more rapid induction and recovery are preferred in those with laryngotrachiomalacia. When possible, cleft palate and hearing loss are best managed by multidisciplinary teams. Surveillance: Annual orthopedic evaluation for progressive scoliosis. Feeding and growth assessment for those with cleft palate by a multidisciplinary team; annual audiologic and dental evaluations. Pregnancy management: Delivery of an affected infant has the potential to be complicated by extended breech presentation due to dislocation of the hips and knees. Genetic counseling AOI, AOIII, Piepkorn osteochondrodysplasia, and Larsen syndrome are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. The proportion of autosomal dominant FLNB disorders caused by de novo pathogenic variants is unknown, although the vast majority of lethal FLNB conditions are caused by de novo events. In rare instances, a parent with low-level mosaicism transmits the causative pathogenic variant to an affected offspring. Each child of an individual with an autosomal dominant FLNB disorder has a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant. Prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk for autosomal dominant FLNB disorders is possible if the pathogenic variant in the family is known. SCT syndrome is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. At conception, each sib of an individual with SCT syndrome has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being a carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Carrier testing for at-risk family members and prenatal testing for SCT syndrome are possible once the pathogenic variants have been identified in the family."

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is divided into two phenotypes: type 1 and type 2. FMF type 1 is characterized by recurrent short episodes of inflammation and serositis including fever, peritonitis, synovitis, pleuritis, and, rarely, pericarditis and meningitis. The symptoms and severity vary among affected individuals, sometimes even among members of the same family. Amyloidosis, which can lead to kidney failure, is the most severe complication, if untreated. FMF type 2 is characterized by amyloidosis as the first clinical manifestation of FMF in an otherwise asymptomatic individual. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of FMF is established in a proband with Tel Hashomer clinical criteria of major and minor features. Major features include fever, abdominal pain, chest pain, joint pain, and skin eruption. Minor features include increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), leukocytosis, and elevated serum fibrinogen. Identification of biallelic MEFV pathogenic variants on molecular genetic testing confirms the diagnosis. Up to 25% of individuals with FMF have only one MEFV pathogenic variant identified. A six-month trial of colchicine therapy can establish the diagnosis if molecular testing is inconclusive. Management Treatment of manifestations: Treatment of an acute episode is mainly supportive, including administration of intravenous saline for hydration and use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), paracetamol, or dipyrone for pain relief; treatment of febrile and inflammatory episodes with NSAIDs; routine treatment of end- stage kidney disease, including kidney transplantation.

Copyright 1993-2024, University of Washington, Seattle. GeneReviews is a registered trademark of the University of Washington, Seattle. All rights reserved. GeneReviews Prevention of primary manifestations: Homozygotes for the p.Met694Val pathogenic variant or compound heterozygotes for p.Met694Val and another disease-causing allele require lifelong treatment with colchicine (1-2 mg/day orally in adults and 0.5-1 mg/day in children according to age and weight). Colchicine prevents the inflammatory attacks and the deposition of amyloid. Individuals who do not have the p.Met694Val pathogenic variant and who are only mildly affected (those with infrequent inflammatory attacks) should either be treated with colchicine or monitored every six months for the presence of proteinuria. Individuals who are homozygous or compound heterozygous for p.Glu148Gln should only be treated with colchicine if they develop severe inflammatory episodes and/or proteinuria as a result of amyloidosis. Symptomatic individuals with a heterozygous MEFV pathogenic variant may benefit from a trial of colchicine. Individuals who are unresponsive to colchicine may respond to intravenous colchicine or one of several other medications. Surveillance: Annual physical examination, urine spot test for protein, and evaluation for hematuria for all affected individuals including those treated with colchicine; consider monitoring of acute-phase reactants (ESR and fibrinogen levels) at regular intervals during attack-free periods, particularly in those with the p.Met694Val pathogenic variant. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Possible worsening of symptoms with cisplatin; possible adverse effect on kidney transplant graft survival with cyclosporin A. Evaluation of relatives at risk: Offer molecular genetic testing to all first-degree relatives and other family members (regardless of symptoms) especially when the p.Met694Val allele is present because renal amyloidosis can be prevented with colchicine treatment. Genetic counseling FMF is usually inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, although recent studies have suggested that some heterozygotes manifest a spectrum of findings from classic FMF to mild FMF. For autosomal recessive FMF: In general, both parents of an affected individual with biallelic MEFV pathogenic variants are unaffected heterozygotes. However, in populations with a high carrier rate and/or a high rate of consanguineous marriages, it is possible that one or both parents have biallelic pathogenic variants and are affected. Symptomatic heterozygotes have also been reported. Thus, it is appropriate to consider molecular genetic testing of the parents of the proband to establish their genetic status. If both parents are heterozygotes, the risk to sibs of inheriting two pathogenic variants and being affected is 25%. Carrier testing for at-risk relatives and prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk are possible if the MEFV pathogenic variants in the family are known."

The manifestations vary among affected individuals, and many have only a subset of the characteristic features. Skin manifestations present at birth include atrophic and hypoplastic areas of skin; cutis aplasia; fat nodules in the dermis manifesting as soft, yellow-pink cutaneous nodules; and pigmentary changes. Verrucous papillomas of the skin and mucous membranes may appear later. The nails can be ridged, dysplastic, or hypoplastic; hair can be sparse or absent. Limb malformations include oligo- and syndactyly and split hand/foot. Developmental abnormalities of the eye can include anophthalmia/microphthalmia, iris and chorioretinal coloboma, and lacrimal duct abnormalities. Craniofacial findings can include facial asymmetry, notched alae nasi, cleft lip and palate, pointed chin, and small, underfolded pinnae.

Agents/circumstances to avoid: Prevent exposure to extreme heat in those with hypohidrosis. Genetic counseling PORCN-related developmental disorders are inherited in an X-linked manner. Females (90% of affected individuals) are heterozygous or mosaic for a PORCN pathogenic variant; most live-born affected males (10% of affected individuals) are mosaic for a de novo PORCN pathogenic variant. It is presumed that most non-mosaic hemizygous males are not viable. Approximately 95% of females with PORCN-related developmental disorders have a de novo pathogenic variant; ~5% inherited the pathogenic variant from a parent. The risk that the PORCN pathogenic variant will be transmitted by an affected heterozygous female is 50%; however, because most male conceptuses with a PORCN pathogenic variant are presumed to be spontaneously aborted, at delivery the expected sex ratio of offspring is: 33% unaffected females; 33% affected females; 33% unaffected males. If the affected female is mosaic for a PORCN pathogenic variant, the risk to her female offspring of inheriting the pathogenic variant depends on the level of mosaicism in her germline and can be as high as 50%. Once the PORCN pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing are possible."

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Hereditary folate malabsorption (HFM) is characterized by folate deficiency due to impaired intestinal folate absorption and impaired folate transport into the central nervous system. Findings include poor feeding, failure to thrive, and anemia. There can be leukopenia and thrombocytopenia, diarrhea and/or oral mucositis, hypoimmunoglobulinemia, and other immunologic dysfunction resulting in infections, most often Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia. Neurologic manifestations include developmental delays, cognitive and motor disorders, behavioral disorders, and seizures. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of HFM is established in a proband with: anemia, impaired absorption of an oral folate load, and very low cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) folate concentration (even after correction of the serum folate concentration); and/or biallelic pathogenic variants in SLC46A1 identified on molecular genetic testing. Management Targeted therapy: Early treatment with intramuscular or high-dose oral 5-formyltetrahydrofolate (5-formylTHF; also known as folinic acid or leucovorin) or, preferably, the active isomer of 5-formylTHF (Isovorin or Fusilev) readily corrects the systemic folate deficiency and, if the dose is sufficient, can achieve CSF folate levels that prevent or mitigate the neurologic consequences of HFM. Dosing is aimed at achieving CSF folate trough concentrations as close as possible to the normal range for the age of the affected individual (infants and children have higher CSF folate levels than adults). Supportive care: Blood transfusion is rarely needed for severe anemia; in affected individuals with selective IgA deficiency, appropriate precautions for blood product transfusion should be taken. Surveillance: To assess adequacy of treatment, surveillance should include: complete blood counts; measurement of serum and CSF folate concentrations; measurement of CSF homocysteine concentrations; and monitoring of Author Affiliation: 1 Departments of Medicine and Molecular Pharmacology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York; Email: i.david.goldman@einsteinmed.edu.

GeneReviews neurologic and cognitive function. Serum immunoglobulins are monitored until they return to the normal range and serum folate level and hemogram remain normal and stable. Agents/circumstances to avoid: If possible, folic acid should not be used for the treatment of HFM because it binds very tightly to the folate receptor. This may impair transport of physiologic folates across the choroid plexus. Evaluation of relatives at risk: For at-risk sibs, molecular genetic testing when the family-specific pathogenic variants are known; otherwise, assessment of serum and CSF folate levels and, if warranted, intestinal absorption of folate, immediately after birth or as soon as the diagnosis is confirmed in the proband. Pregnancy management: Affected women should increase their 5-formylTHF intake above the maintenance dose well in advance of attempting to conceive; infants with HFM do not appear to be at increased risk for neural malformations typically associated with maternal folate deficiency during pregnancy, but care must be taken to assure that maternal folate intake is increased and sufficient. Genetic counseling HFM is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. If both parents are known to be heterozygous for an SLC46A1 pathogenic variant, each sib of an affected individual has at conception a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of inheriting neither of the familial SLC46A1 pathogenic variants. If both pathogenic variants have been identified in the family, carrier testing for at-risk relatives, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk, and preimplantation genetic testing for HFM are possible."

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics FOLR1-related cerebral folate transport deficiency (FOLR1-CFTD), resulting from loss of function of the folate receptor alpha (FOLR1) protein, causes cerebral folate deficiency in the absence of systemic folate deficiency. Individuals with untreated FOLR1-CFTD have very low cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels and progressive neurologic deterioration with developmental delays and progressive cognitive impairment, behavioral issues, seizures, and movement disorders that may progress to immobility. Despite these incapacitating neurologic findings, untreated individuals can live well into adulthood. Treatment with 5-formyltetrahydrofolate (5-formylTHF; also known as folinic acid or leucovorin) can result in substantial improvement in neurologic findings when started at a young age. Treatment of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic younger sibs at the time of diagnosis of their older sibs can either prevent the neurologic signs of this disorder or result in marked or complete regression of the neurologic findings. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of FOLR1-CFTD is established in a proband with biallelic FOLR1 pathogenic variants identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Targeted therapy: Treatment with 5-formylTHF can bring CSF folate levels into the normal range for the age of the individual. While oral administration is often sufficient, intramuscular administration may be necessary. Monitoring CSF folate levels is essential to ensure that the dose of 5-formylTHF is sufficient, particularly when the clinical response is inadequate or there is uncertainty about adherence.

GeneReviews Surveillance: For those being treated with 5-formylTHF, the following is recommended for monitoring CSF folate levels, taking into consideration the complexity of lumbar puncture, particularly in infants and children: baseline CSF folate level obtained at the time of diagnosis; once treatment has begun, repeat CSF folate levels obtained to confirm that an adequate therapeutic dose and optimal clinical outcome has been achieved; repeat CSF folate levels if there are changes in the individual's clinical status (e.g., developmental delays or regression, new-onset neurologic findings, seizures) or if there are concerns regarding adherence; optimally and if feasible, yearly CSF folate levels until age five years. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Folic acid is not used to treat FOLR1-CFTD because folic acid binds tightly to FOLR1, possibly interfering with FOLR1 function, which is a concern when treating individuals who have residual FOLR1 activity. Evaluation of relatives at risk: Clarification of the genetic status of all sibs of a proband is recommended to identify as early as possible those sibs who would benefit from prompt initiation of treatment with 5-formylTHF. Newborns at risk should be evaluated for the familial FOLR1 pathogenic variants if molecular genetic testing was not performed prenatally. Genetic counseling FOLR1-CFTD is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. If both parents are known to be heterozygous for an FOLR1 pathogenic variant, each sib of an affected individual has at conception a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. If both pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member, carrier testing for at-risk relatives, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk, and preimplantation genetic testing for FOLR1-CFTD are possible."

Painful, recurrent soft-tissue swellings (flare-ups) may precede localized heterotopic ossification. Heterotopic ossification can occur at any location, but typically affects regions in close proximity to the axial skeleton in the early/mild stages, before progressing to the appendicular skeleton. This can lead to restriction of movement as a result of ossification impacting joint mobility. Problems with swallowing and speaking can occur with ossification affecting the jaw, head, and neck, and restriction of the airway and breathing may lead to thoracic insufficiency syndrome.

Genetic counseling FOXP1 syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder typically caused by a de novo pathogenic variant. To date, most probands with FOXP1 syndrome whose parents have undergone molecular genetic testing have the disorder as the result of a de novo FOXP1 pathogenic variant. Rarely, a parent of an individual with FOXP1 syndrome has somatic and germline mosaicism for the FOXP1 pathogenic variant or a complex chromosome arrangement involving FOXP1. Each child of an individual with FOXP1 syndrome has a 50% chance of inheriting the FOXP1 pathogenic variant. Risk to future offspring of the parents of the proband is presumed to be low, as the proband most likely has a de novo FOXP1 pathogenic variant. There is, however, a recurrence risk (~1%) to sibs based on the possibility of parental germline mosaicism; given this risk, prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing may be considered."

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics FOXP2-related speech and language disorder (FOXP2-SLD) is caused by heterozygous FOXP2 pathogenic variants (including whole- or partial-gene deletions). The core phenotype of FOXP2-SLD is childhood apraxia of speech (CAS), a disorder of speech motor programming or planning that affects the production, sequencing, timing, and stress of sounds, and the accurate sequencing of speech sounds into syllables and syllables into words. CAS also interferes nonselectively with multiple other aspects of language, including phonology, grammar, and literacy. Additional findings in FOXP2-SLD can include oral-motor dyspraxia (difficulty planning or programming oral movements on command); dysarthria; moderate-to-severe receptive and expressive language disorder; reading and spelling impairments; and fine motor difficulties. Nonverbal (performance) IQ is typically relatively preserved compared to verbal IQ; gross motor skills are normal. Autistic features or a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder have been reported in some individuals. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of FOXP2-SLD is established in a proband with suggestive findings and a heterozygous pathogenic (or likely pathogenic) variant in FOXP2 identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: There is no cure for FOXP2-SLD. Supportive care to improve quality of life, maximize function, and reduce complications is recommended.

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics FMR1 disorders include fragile X syndrome (FXS), fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), and fragile X-associated primary ovarian insufficiency (FXPOI). Fragile X syndrome occurs in individuals with an FMR1 full mutation or other loss-of-function variant and is nearly always characterized in affected males by developmental delay and intellectual disability along with a variety of behavioral issues. Autism spectrum disorder is present in 50%-70% of individuals with FXS. Affected males may have characteristic craniofacial features (which become more obvious with age) and medical problems including hypotonia, gastroesophageal reflux, strabismus, seizures, sleep disorders, joint laxity, pes planus, scoliosis, and recurrent otitis media. Adults may have mitral valve prolapse or aortic root dilatation. The physical and behavioral features seen in males with FXS have been reported in females heterozygous for the FMR1 full mutation, but with lower frequency and milder involvement. FXTAS occurs in individuals who have an FMR1 premutation and is characterized by late-onset, progressive cerebellar ataxia and intention tremor followed by cognitive impairment. Psychiatric disorders are common. Age of onset is typically between 60 and 65 years and is more common among males who are hemizygous for the premutation (40%) than among females who are heterozygous for the premutation (16%-20%). FXPOI, defined as hypergonadotropic hypogonadism before age 40 years, has been observed in 20% of women who carry a premutation allele compared to 1% in the general population. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of an FMR1 disorder is established through the use of specialized molecular genetic testing to detect CGG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the 5' UTR of FMR1 with abnormal gene methylation for most alleles with >200 repeats. Typically, a definite diagnosis of FXS requires the presence of a full-mutation repeat Author Affiliations: 1 Center for Health Research, Kaiser Permanente Northwest, Portland, Oregon; Email: jessica.e.hunter@kpchr.org. 2 Departments of Pediatrics, Neurological Sciences, and Biochemistry, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois; Email: elizabeth_berry-kravis@rush.edu. 3 Division of Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia; Email: hhipp@emory.edu. 4 Department of Neurology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan; Email: petertod@med.umich.edu.

GeneReviews size (>200 CGG repeats) while the diagnosis of FXTAS or FXPOI is associated with a premutation-sized repeat (55-200 CGG repeats). It should be noted that typical multigene panels and comprehensive genomic testing (exome or genome sequencing) are useful only when no CGG repeat expansion is detected but FXS is still suspected. Management Treatment of manifestations: Fragile X syndrome: supportive and symptom-based therapy for children and adults typically consisting of a dual approach of psychopharmacologic treatment of symptoms as needed in conjunction with therapeutic services, such as behavioral intervention, speech and language therapy, occupational therapy, and individualized educational support; routine treatment of medical problems. FXTAS: symptomatic and supportive and should be tailored to the individual. FXPOI: Gynecologic or reproductive endocrinologic evaluation can provide appropriate treatment and counseling for reproductive considerations and hormone replacement. Agents/circumstances to avoid: FXTAS: typical and atypical antipsychotics with significant anti-dopaminergic effects and metoclopramide, which can exacerbate parkinsonism; anticholinergic agents, which can exacerbate cognitive complaints; excessive alcohol, which can enhance cerebellar dysfunction and postural instability; agents with known cerebellar toxicity or side effects. FXPOI: tobacco use as this decreases ovarian reserve and the age of onset of FXPOI. Genetic counseling FMR1 disorders are inherited in an X-linked manner. All mothers of individuals with an FMR1 full mutation (expansion >200 CGG trinucleotide repeats and abnormal methylation) are heterozygous for an FMR1 pathogenic variant. Mothers and their female relatives who are heterozygous for a premutation are at increased risk for FXTAS, FXPOI, and fragile X-associated neuropsychiatric disorders (FXAND); those with a full mutation may have findings of fragile X syndrome. All are at increased risk of having offspring with fragile X syndrome, FXTAS, FXPOI, or FXAND. Males with premutations are at increased risk for FXTAS. Males with FXTAS will transmit their FMR1 premutation expansion to all of their daughters, who will be heterozygous for a premutation and at increased risk for FXTAS, FXPOI, and FXAND. Males with FXTAS do not transmit their FMR1 premutation to sons. Prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible once an expanded (or altered) FMR1 allele has been identified in a family member."

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Typical Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is characterized by progressive ataxia with onset from early childhood to early adulthood with mean age at onset from 10 to 15 years (range: age two years to the eighth decade). Ataxia, manifesting initially as poor balance when walking, is typically followed by upper-limb ataxia, dysarthria, dysphagia, peripheral motor and sensory neuropathy, spasticity, autonomic disturbance, and often abnormal eye movements and optic atrophy. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is present in about two thirds of individuals; occasionally it is diagnosed prior to the onset of ataxia. Diabetes mellitus and impaired glucose tolerance can also occur. Among individuals with FRDA, about 75% have \\\"typical Friedreich ataxia\\\" and about 25% of individuals with biallelic FXN full-penetrance GAA repeat expansions have \\\"atypical Friedreich ataxia\\\" that includes late-onset FRDA (LOFA) (i.e., onset after age 25 years), very late-onset FRDA (VLOFA) (i.e., onset after age 40 years), and FRDA with retained reflexes (FARR). Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of Friedreich ataxia is established in a proband with suggestive findings and biallelic pathogenic variants in FXN identified by molecular genetic testing. The two classes of FXN pathogenic variants are (1) GAA repeat expansions and (2) FXN pathogenic sequence variants, including base substitutions and small indels or large deletions. Approximately 96% of individuals with FRDA have biallelic FXN GAA repeat expansions in intron 1; approximately 4% are compound heterozygotes for an FXN GAA repeat expansion and either an intragenic FXN pathogenic variant or a large deletion.

Management GeneReviews Targeted therapy: Omaveloxolone, an Nrf2 activator, has been shown to slow the progression of FRDA; it is approved in the United States and Europe for individuals age 16 years and older. Supportive care: Multidisciplinary care by specialists in relevant fields, such as neurologists, ophthalmologists, orthoptists, physical therapists, occupational therapists, cardiologists, endocrinologists, speech and language therapists, and psychologists. Surveillance: Routinely scheduled evaluations by the treating multidisciplinary specialists. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Use and misuse of illegal and controlled drugs, as they may affect neuronal well- being and, thus, exacerbate disease manifestations; medications that are toxic or potentially toxic to people with neuropathy; circumstances that increase the risk of falling (e.g., rough surfaces). Evaluation of relatives at risk: If at-risk minor and adult sibs of an individual with FRDA have not had testing for the FXN pathogenic variant(s) in their family, they should be offered echocardiography surveillance to determine if treatable cardiac manifestations of presymptomatic disease are present. Pregnancy management: Worsening, improving, or unchanged manifestations during pregnancy were each reported with equal frequency by women with FRDA. Close cardiac monitoring and regular testing for diabetes mellitus during pregnancy is recommended in any woman with FRDA. If cesarean section is required, epidural or spinal anesthesia is recommended rather than general anesthesia if possible. Genetic counseling FRDA is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. If both parents are heterozygous for a pathogenic variant in FXN, each sib of an affected individual has at conception a 25% chance of inheriting biallelic FRDA-related genetic alterations, a 50% chance of inheriting one FRDA-related genetic alteration, and a 25% chance of inheriting neither of the familial FRDA-related genetic alterations. Sibs who inherit biallelic FXN pathogenic variants will be affected. Once the FRDA-related genetic alterations have been identified in an affected family member, carrier testing for at-risk relatives and prenatal/preimplantation genetic testing are possible."

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBP1) deficiency is characterized by episodic acute crises of lactic acidosis and ketotic hypoglycemia, manifesting as hyperventilation, apneic spells, seizures, and/or coma. Acute crises are most common in early childhood; nearly half of affected children have hypoglycemia in the neonatal period (especially the first 4 days) resulting from deficient glycogen stores. Factors known to trigger episodes include fever, fasting, decreased oral intake, vomiting, infections, and ingestion of large amounts of fructose. In untreated individuals, symptoms worsen progressively as continued catabolism leads to multiorgan failure (especially liver, brain, and later heart). Morbidity and mortality are high. Sepsis, blindness, and Reye syndrome- like presentation have been reported. In between acute episodes, children are asymptomatic. While the majority of affected children have normal growth and psychomotor development, a few have intellectual disability, presumably due to early and prolonged hypoglycemia. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of FBP1 deficiency is established in a proband with suggestive clinical and metabolic findings by identification of EITHER biallelic FBP1 pathogenic variants on molecular genetic testing OR deficient fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase 1 (FBP1) activity in liver or mononuclear white blood cells. Molecular genetic testing is generally preferred because of its widespread availability and accuracy. Management Treatment of manifestations: Intervention (oral or IV glucose) should take place early in an acute crisis while the blood glucose is normal due to the possibility of delayed hypoglycemia, which only occurs relatively late in the course of acute metabolic decompensation.

GeneReviews The mainstay of routine daily management is prevention of hypoglycemia by avoiding fasting (including use of uncooked cornstarch overnight), consuming frequent meals, and appropriate management of acute intercurrent illnesses. Prevention of primary manifestations: Routine daily management to prevent hypoglycemia, attention to agents/ circumstances to avoid, and routine immunizations, including annual influenza vaccine to reduce the risk of infection, which can precipitate hypoglycemia. Surveillance: Long-term monitoring of developmental milestones in affected children and quality of life issues for affected individuals and their parents/caregivers; monitoring for excessive weight gain at each visit. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Food items or medicines that contain fructose, sucrose, glycerol, and/or sorbitol, especially during acute crisis in infancy or early childhood. Although small amounts of fructose (2 g/kg/day) are generally well tolerated, single ingestion of high dose of fructose (>1g/kg) is harmful, especially in younger children. Fructose tolerance testing (\\\"fructose challenge\\\") to diagnose FBP1 deficiency can be hazardous and should not be performed. Evaluation of relatives at risk: When the familial FBP1 variants are known, it is appropriate to clarify the genetic status of apparently asymptomatic older and younger at-risk sibs of an affected individual in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from prompt initiation of preventive measures. Pregnancy management: For a pregnant woman with FBP1 deficiency, consider referral to a high-risk obstetric center and consultation with a metabolic physician. Home glucose monitoring and consumption of uncooked cornstarch at night as needed as carbohydrate requirements increase during pregnancy. During labor, continuous glucose infusion is recommended to maintain euglycemia. Genetic counseling FBP1 deficiency is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. When both parents are known to be heterozygous for an FBP1 pathogenic variant, each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Once the FBP1 pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member, carrier testing for at-risk relatives, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk, and preimplantation genetic testing are possible."

A broad range of clinical features both within and between families is observed. The age of onset ranges from 35 to 87 years. Behavioral disturbances are the most common early feature, followed by progressive aphasia. Impairment in executive function manifests as loss of judgment and insight. In early stages, PPA often manifests as deficits in naming, word finding, or word comprehension. In late stages, affected individuals often become mute and lose their ability to communicate. Early findings of parkinsonism include rigidity, bradykinesia or akinesia (slowing or absence of movements), limb dystonia, apraxia (loss of ability to carry out learned purposeful movements), and disequilibrium. Late motor findings may include myoclonus, dysarthria, and dysphagia. Most affected individuals eventually lose the ability to walk. Disease duration is three to 12 years. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of GRN-FTD is established in a proband with suggestive findings and a heterozygous pathogenic variant in GRN identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Behavioral manifestations such as apathy, impulsivity, and compulsiveness may respond to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Roaming, delusions, and hallucinations may respond to antipsychotic medications. Reports have suggested potential benefits with certain pharmacotherapy on management of FTD; however, evidence from randomized controlled trials is limited.

GeneReviews suggested that trazodone may be helpful for treating irritability, agitation, depression, and eating disorders; methylphenidate and dextro-amphetamine may help minimize risk-taking behavior. Cholinesterase inhibitors examined in clinical trials were generally well tolerated: galantamine was used to treat PPA with stabilization of symptoms; rivastigmine was used to treat behavioral manifestations and appeared to decrease caregiver burden. Two open-label studies of memantine, an NMDA partial agonist-antagonist, demonstrated some efficacy on frontal behavior in those with bvFTD and improvement in cognitive performance in those with PPA-PNFA. Genetic counseling GRN-FTD is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. About 95% of individuals diagnosed with GRN-FTD have an affected parent. The proportion of affected individuals with a de novo GRN pathogenic variant is unknown but is estimated to be 5% or fewer.

A recent retrospective study suggested that the majority of affected individuals have either behavioral changes consistent with a diagnosis of behavioral variant FTD (bvFTD) or, less commonly, a parkinsonian syndrome (i.e., progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal syndrome, or Parkinson disease). Fewer than 5% of people with MAPT-FTD have primary progressive aphasia or Alzheimer disease. Clinical presentation may differ between and within families with the same MAPT variant. MAPT-FTD is a progressive disorder that commonly ends with a relatively global dementia in which some affected individuals become mute. Progression of motor impairment in affected individuals results in some becoming chairbound and others bedbound. Mean disease duration is 9.3 (SD: 6.4) years but is individually variable and can be more than 30 years in some instances. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of MAPT-FTD is established in a proband with suggestive findings and a heterozygous pathogenic (or likely pathogenic) variant in MAPT identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: There is no cure for MAPT-FTD. Supportive care to improve quality of life, maximize function, and reduce complications is recommended.

Brain malformations including bilateral polymicrogyria and absence of the corpus callosum can also be observed. Development is severely affected: most affected individuals are nonverbal and nonambulatory, and many die during early childhood. Less severely affected individuals with moderate cognitive impairment and long-term survival have been reported. Diagnosis/testing Isolated increased fumaric acid and alpha-ketoglutarate on urine organic acid analysis, combined with increased succinyladenosine on urine purines and pyrimidines is highly suggestive of FH deficiency.

Genetic counseling FH deficiency is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. When both parents are known to be heterozygous for an FH pathogenic variant, each sib of an affected individual has at conception a 25% chance of having FH deficiency, a 50% chance of being heterozygous, and a 25% chance of inheriting neither of the familial FH pathogenic variants. Heterozygotes are at risk of developing hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer. Once the FH pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member, heterozygote detection for at-risk relatives and molecular genetic prenatal testing and preimplantation genetic testing are possible. Biochemical prenatal testing by measurement of fumarate hydratase enzyme activity is also possible but may be problematic as some affected fetuses have considerable residual fumarate hydratase enzyme activity."

Additional findings can include typical skin and retinal manifestations of pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE), periarticular calcifications, development of rickets after infancy, cervical spine fusion, and hearing loss. While mortality in infancy is high, survival into the third and fourth decades has occurred. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of GACI is established in a proband with cardiovascular symptoms during infancy associated with widespread arterial calcification on imaging (once secondary causes have been ruled out) and biallelic pathogenic variants in ENPP1 or ABCC6 identified on molecular genetic testing.

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics The term \\\"galactosemia\\\" refers to disorders of galactose metabolism that include classic galactosemia, clinical variant galactosemia, and biochemical variant galactosemia (not covered in this chapter). This GeneReview focuses on: Classic galactosemia, which can result in life-threatening complications including feeding problems, failure to thrive, hepatocellular damage, bleeding, and E coli sepsis in untreated infants. If a lactose- restricted diet is provided during the first ten days of life, the neonatal signs usually quickly resolve and the complications of liver failure, sepsis, and neonatal death are prevented; however, despite adequate treatment from an early age, children with classic galactosemia remain at increased risk for developmental delays, speech problems (termed childhood apraxia of speech and dysarthria), and abnormalities of motor function. Almost all females with classic galactosemia manifest hypergonadatropic hypogonadism or premature ovarian insufficiency (POI). Clinical variant galactosemia, which can result in life-threatening complications including feeding problems, failure to thrive, hepatocellular damage including cirrhosis, and bleeding in untreated infants. This is exemplified by the disease that occurs in African Americans and native Africans in South Africa. Persons with clinical variant galactosemia may be missed with newborn screening as the hypergalactosemia is not as marked as in classic galactosemia and breath testing is normal. If a lactose- restricted diet is provided during the first ten days of life, the severe acute neonatal complications are usually prevented. African Americans with clinical variant galactosemia and adequate early treatment do not appear to be at risk for long-term complications, including POI.

GeneReviews is a registered trademark of the University of Washington, Seattle. All rights reserved. Diagnosis/testing GeneReviews The diagnosis of classic galactosemia and clinical variant galactosemia is established by detection of elevated erythrocyte galactose-1-phosphate concentration, reduced erythrocyte galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltranserase (GALT) enzyme activity, and/or biallelic pathogenic variants in GALT. In classic galactosemia, erythrocyte galactose-1-phosphate is usually >10 mg/dL and erythrocyte GALT enzyme activity is absent or barely detectable. In clinical variant galactosemia, erythrocyte GALT enzyme activity is close to or above 1% of control values but probably never >10%-15%. However, in African Americans with clinical variant galactosemia, the erythrocyte GALT enzyme activity may be absent or barely detectable but is often much higher in liver and in intestinal tissue (e.g., 10% of control values). Virtually 100% of infants with classic galactosemia or clinical variant galactosemia can be detected in newborn screening programs that include testing for galactosemia in their panel. However, infants with clinical variant galactosemia may be missed if the program only measures blood total galactose level and not erythrocyte GALT enzyme activity. Management Treatment of manifestations: Standard of care in any newborn who is \\\"screen-positive\\\" for galactosemia is immediate dietary intervention while diagnostic testing is under way. Once a diagnosis is confirmed, restriction of galactose intake is continued and all milk products are replaced with lactose-free formulas (e.g., Isomil or Prosobee) containing non-galactose carbohydrates; dietary restrictions on all lactose-containing foods and other dairy products should continue throughout life, although management of the diet becomes less important after infancy and early childhood. In rare instances, cataract surgery may be needed in the first year of life. Childhood apraxia of speech and dysarthria require expert speech therapy. Developmental assessment at age one year by a psychologist and/or developmental pediatrician is recommended in order to formulate a treatment plan with the speech therapist and treating physician. For school-age children, an individual education plan and/or professional help with learning skills and special classrooms as needed. Hormone replacement therapy as needed for delayed pubertal development and/or primary or secondary amenorrhea. Stimulation with follicle- stimulating hormone may be useful in producing ovulation in some women. Prevention of secondary complications: Recommended calcium, vitamin D, and vitamin K intake to help prevent decreased bone mineralization; standard treatment for gastrointestinal dysfunction. Surveillance: Biochemical genetics clinic visits every three months for the first year of life or as needed depending on the nature of the potential acute complications; every six months during the second year of life; yearly thereafter. Routine monitoring for: the accumulation of toxic analytes (e.g., erythrocyte galactose-1-phosphate and urinary galactitol); cataracts; speech and development; movement disorder; POI; nutritional deficiency; and osteoporosis. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Breast milk, proprietary infant formulas containing lactose, cow's milk, dairy products, and casein or whey-containing foods; medications with lactose and galactose. Evaluation of relatives at risk: To allow for earliest possible diagnosis and treatment of at-risk sibs: Perform prenatal diagnosis when the GALT pathogenic variants in the family are known; or If prenatal testing has not been performed, test the newborn for either the family-specific GALT pathogenic variants or erythrocyte GALT enzyme activity. Pregnancy management: Women with classic galactosemia should maintain a lactose-restricted diet during pregnancy. Galactosemia and Clinical Variant Galactosemia 3 Genetic counseling Classic galactosemia and clinical variant galactosemia are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Couples who have had one affected child have a 25% chance of having an affected child in each subsequent pregnancy. Molecular genetic carrier testing for at-risk sibs and prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk are an option if the GALT pathogenic variants in the family are known. If the GALT pathogenic variants in a family are not known, prenatal testing can rely on assay of GALT enzyme activity in cultured amniotic fluid cells."

Enzyme activity is profoundly decreased in all tissues tested. Peripheral. Enzyme activity is deficient in red blood cells (RBC) and circulating white blood cells, but normal or near normal in all other tissues. Intermediate. Enzyme activity is deficient in red blood cells and circulating white blood cells and less than 50% of normal levels in other cells tested. Infants with generalized epimerase deficiency galactosemia develop clinical findings on a regular milk diet (which contains lactose, a disaccharide of galactose and glucose); manifestations include hypotonia, poor feeding, vomiting, weight loss, jaundice, hepatomegaly, liver dysfunction, aminoaciduria, and cataracts. Prompt removal of galactose/lactose from their diet resolves or prevents these acute symptoms. Longer-term features that may be seen in those with generalized epimerase deficiency include short stature, developmental delay, sensorineural hearing loss, and skeletal anomalies. In contrast, neonates with the peripheral or intermediate form generally remain clinically well even on a regular milk diet and are usually only identified by biochemical testing, often in newborn screening programs.

GeneReviews generalized and the milder intermediate or peripheral forms of epimerase deficiency; further enzymatic testing in other cell types such as stimulated leukocytes or EBV-transformed lymphoblasts is required to make that distinction. Management Treatment of manifestations: The common acute and potentially lethal symptoms of generalized epimerase deficiency galactosemia are prevented or corrected by a galactose/lactose-restricted diet. Note: Affected individuals may require trace environmental sources of galactose: infants should be fed a formula (e.g., soy formula) that contains trace levels of galactose or lactose. Continued dietary restriction of dairy products in older children is recommended. In contrast, infants with peripheral epimerase deficiency galactosemia are believed to remain asymptomatic regardless of diet; infants with intermediate epimerase deficiency galactosemia may benefit in the long term from early dietary galactose/lactose restriction, but this remains unclear. Standard treatment for developmental delay, skeletal anomalies, poor weight gain / failure to thrive, mature cataracts, and sensorineural hearing loss. Prevention of primary manifestations: In generalized epimerase deficiency galactosemia, restriction of dietary galactose/lactose appears to correct or prevent the common acute signs and symptoms of the disorder (hepatic dysfunction, renal dysfunction, and mild cataracts), but not the developmental delay or learning impairment observed in some affected individuals. Because of the difficulty in distinguishing peripheral and intermediate forms of epimerase deficiency galactosemia, dietary restriction of galactose/lactose is recommended for all infants with GALE deficiency, relaxing the restriction, as warranted, once a more accurate diagnosis has been confirmed. Surveillance: Hemolysate gal-1P (galactose-1-phosphate) or urinary galactitol is monitored, especially if the diet is to be normalized. Acceptable levels of RBC gal-1P are not known, but are estimated to be <3.5 mg/100 mL (normal 1.0 mg/100 mL) on data from classic galactosemia. Other parameters that warrant monitoring are growth and developmental milestones, vision, and hearing (particularly in those in whom hearing loss has been identified). Agents/circumstances to avoid: Dietary galactose/lactose in persons with generalized epimerase deficiency galactosemia, certainly as infants and perhaps for life. Evaluation of relatives at risk: Each at-risk newborn sib should be treated with dietary restriction of galactose from birth while awaiting results of diagnostic testing for epimerase deficiency galactosemia; either molecular genetic testing (if the pathogenic variants in the family are known) or measurement of GALE enzyme activity in RBC (if the pathogenic variants in the family are not known) can be performed. Genetic counseling Epimerase deficiency galactosemia is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. If both parents are known to be heterozygous for a GALE pathogenic variant, each full sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier.

The classic giant axonal neuropathy phenotype typically manifests as an infantile-onset neurodegenerative disorder, starting as a severe peripheral motor and sensory neuropathy and evolving into central nervous system impairment (intellectual disability, seizures, cerebellar signs, and pyramidal tract signs). Most affected individuals become wheelchair dependent in the second decade of life and eventually bedridden with severe polyneuropathy, ataxia, and dementia. Death usually occurs in the third decade.

The characterization of three major clinical types (1, 2, and 3) and two clinical forms (perinatal-lethal and cardiovascular) is useful in determining prognosis and management. Cardiopulmonary complications have been described with all the clinical phenotypes, although varying in frequency and severity. Type 1 GD is characterized by the presence of clinical or radiographic evidence of bone disease (osteopenia, focal lytic or sclerotic lesions, and osteonecrosis), hepatosplenomegaly, anemia, thrombocytopenia, lung disease, and the absence of primary central nervous system disease. Type 2 GD is characterized by primary central nervous system disease with onset before age two years, limited psychomotor development, and a rapidly progressive course with death by age two to four years. Type 3 GD is characterized by primary central nervous system disease with childhood onset, a more slowly progressive course, and survival into the third or fourth decade. The perinatal-lethal form is associated with ichthyosiform or collodion skin abnormalities or with nonimmune hydrops fetalis. The cardiovascular form is characterized by calcification of the aortic and mitral valves, mild splenomegaly, corneal opacities, and supranuclear ophthalmoplegia. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of GD relies on demonstration of deficient glucocerebrosidase (glucosylceramidase) enzyme activity in peripheral blood leukocytes or other nucleated cells, or by the identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in GBA1 on molecular genetic testing.

Management GeneReviews Targeted therapy: Options include enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) or substrate reduction therapy (SRT; e.g., miglustat, eliglustat). Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation may be an option in individuals with severe GD, primarily those with chronic neurologic involvement (type 3 GD). Supportive care: When possible, management by a multidisciplinary team at a GD Comprehensive Treatment Center. Symptomatic treatment includes partial or total splenectomy for those with massive splenomegaly, significant areas of splenic fibrosis, and persistent significant thrombocytopenia (platelets <30,000/mm3) with a risk of bleeding; splenectomy may be needed even in those on targeted therapy. Supportive care for all affected individuals may include: orthopedic management of bone disease; analgesics for bone pain; joint replacement surgery for relief from chronic pain and restoration of function; anti-bone resorptive agents, calcium, and vitamin D for osteoporosis; transfusion of blood products for severe anemia and bleeding; the use of anticoagulants in individuals with severe thrombocytopenia and/or coagulopathy should be discussed with a hematologist to avoid the possibility of excessive bleeding; treatment of cholelithiasis, pulmonary disease, pulmonary hypertension, multiple myeloma, psychological manifestations, parkinsonism, and seizures according to the relevant specialist; social work support and care coordination as needed. Surveillance: Clinical assessment of disease progression at least every six months to include hematologic, orthopedic, pulmonary, cardiac, psychiatric, and neurologic assessment; clinical assessment for abdominal pain, early satiety, evidence of bleeding diathesis, growth and weight gain, clinical disease markers, and liver enzymes; imaging for spleen and liver volumes at least every one to two years. Additional evaluations to be done as needed include radiographs, MRI, and dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan; bone age in children with growth and pubertal delay; ultrasound for gallstones; serum iron, ferritin, and vitamin B12 in those with anemia; and EKG and echocardiography with Doppler in individuals after splenectomy and those with elevated pulmonary artery pressure. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in individuals with moderate-to-severe thrombocytopenia. Evaluation of relatives at risk: It is appropriate to offer testing to asymptomatic at-risk relatives so that those with glucocerebrosidase enzyme deficiency or biallelic pathogenic variants can benefit from early diagnosis and treatment if indicated. Pregnancy management: Pregnancy can exacerbate preexisting symptoms and trigger new features in affected women. Those with severe thrombocytopenia and/or clotting abnormalities are at increased risk for bleeding around the time of delivery. Evaluation by a hematologist prior to delivery is recommended. The lack of studies on the safety of eliglustat use during pregnancy and lactation has led to the recommendation that this medication be avoided during pregnancy, if possible. Genetic counseling GD is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. The parents of an affected individual are typically heterozygous for a GBA1 pathogenic variant; in some families, an asymptomatic parent may be found to be homozygous rather than heterozygous. If both parents are known to be heterozygous for a GBA1 pathogenic variant, each sib of an affected individual has at conception a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being a heterozygote, and a 25% chance of inheriting neither of the familial GBA1 pathogenic variants. Once the GBA1 pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member, molecular genetic carrier testing for at-risk family members, preimplantation genetic testing, and prenatal testing for GD are possible. The identification of 0%-15% of normal glucocerebrosidase enzyme activity in fetal samples obtained by chorionic villus sampling (CVS) or amniocentesis ideally complemented by molecular genetic testing can also be used to establish affected status in a fetus.

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics SCN1A seizure disorders encompass a spectrum that ranges from simple febrile seizures and generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+) at the mild end to Dravet syndrome and intractable childhood epilepsy with generalized tonic-clonic seizures (ICE-GTC) at the severe end. Phenotypes with intractable seizures including Dravet syndrome are often associated with cognitive decline. Less commonly observed phenotypes include myoclonic astatic epilepsy (MAE), Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, infantile spasms, epilepsy with focal seizures, and vaccine-related encephalopathy and seizures. The phenotype of SCN1A seizure disorders can vary even within the same family. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of an SCN1A seizure disorder is established in a proband by identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in SCN1A by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Care is best provided by a physician (e.g., pediatric epileptologist) familiar with the pharmacotherapy for this disorder. Seizure control is critical to prevent permanent injury and death. Anti- seizure medication (ASM): clobazam (can be used for treatment of seizures in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome); stiripentol, benzodiazepines, cannabidiol, topiramate, levetiracetam, valproic acid, and ethosuximide. Levetiracetam is often effective, but may make seizures worse in some individuals. Phenobarbital is effective but poorly tolerated because of its effects on cognition. Use of the ketogenic diet to decrease seizure frequency has been beneficial in some affected individuals. Parents are advised to take a CPR course. Routine seizure and personal safety education is indicated.

GeneReviews Prevention of secondary complications: Use of protective helmets by individuals with atonic seizures or myoclonic-astatic epilepsy. Good sleep hygiene should be encouraged. Persons with epilepsy should be made aware of motor vehicle driving laws. Surveillance: Serial neuropsychological evaluation for neurologic, cognitive, and behavioral deterioration; EEG monitoring for new or different seizure types; polysomnography should be considered if obstructive or central sleep apnea is suspected. Agents/circumstances to avoid: ASMs: carbamazepine, lamotrigine, and vigabatrin, which can induce or increase myoclonic seizures; phenytoin, which can induce choreoathetosis; rufinamide may exacerbate seizures as well; acetaminophen, which is hepatotoxic. Activities in which a sudden loss of consciousness could lead to injury or death (e.g., bathing, swimming, driving, or working/playing at heights). Sleep deprivation, which can exacerbate seizures, should be avoided. Pregnancy management: Pregnant women should receive counseling regarding the risks and benefits of the use of anti-seizure medication during pregnancy; the advantages and disadvantages of increasing maternal periconceptional folic acid supplementation to 4,000 g daily; the effects of pregnancy on anticonvulsant metabolism; and the effect of pregnancy on maternal seizure control. Genetic counseling SCN1A seizure disorders are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. A proband with an SCN1A seizure disorder may have an inherited or a de novo pathogenic variant. The proportion of cases caused by de novo pathogenic variants varies by phenotype: the percentage of probands with an SCN1A seizure disorder and an affected parent decreases as the severity of the phenotype in the proband increases; thus, most SCN1A-related severe myoclonic epilepsy in infancy (SCN1A-SMEI) and ICE-GTC are the result of a de novo pathogenic variant. Each child of an individual with an SCN1A seizure disorder has a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant; however, the risk of developing seizures is less than 100% because of reduced penetrance. Prenatal diagnosis for pregnancies at increased risk is possible if the pathogenic variant in the family is known."

Geleophysic dysplasia caused by a heterozygous pathogenic variant in either FBN1 or LTBP3 is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner.

Carrier testing for at-risk relatives requires prior identification of the ADAMTSL2 pathogenic variants in the family. Autosomal dominant inheritance: All probands reported to date with FBN1- or LTBP3-related geleophysic dysplasia whose parents have undergone molecular genetic testing have had the disorder as the result of a de novo pathogenic variant. If a molecular diagnosis has been established in the proband and the pathogenic variant identified in the proband is not identified in either parent, the recurrence risk to sibs is estimated to be 1% because of the possibility of parental germline mosaicism.

Symptoms include photophobia, blepharospasm, and excessive tearing. Typically, the diagnosis is made in the first year of life. Depending on when treatment is instituted, visual acuity may be reduced and/or visual fields may be restricted. In untreated individuals, blindness invariably occurs. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of PCG is based on clinical criteria including: elevated IOP in a child typically before age one year, enlargement of the globe, increased corneal diameter, cloudy corneas, breaks in Decsemets membrane (Haabs striae) and anomalously deep anterior chamber. Identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in CYP1B1 or LTBP2 or identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in TEK confirms the diagnosis if clinical features are inconclusive. Management Treatment of manifestations: Surgery (goniotomy, trabeculotomy, trabeculectomy, or deep sclerectomy) as early as possible; use of drainage implants or cyclodestruction if surgery fails; medication preoperatively and postoperatively to help control IOP; routine treatment of refractive errors and amblyopia. Prevention of secondary complications: Discontinuation of medications such as Phospholine Iodide (echothiophate) before surgery to prevent prolonged apnea.

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics The phenotypic spectrum of glucose transporter type 1 deficiency syndrome (Glut1 DS) is now known to be a continuum that includes the classic phenotype as well as paroxysmal exercise-induced dyskinesia and epilepsy (previously known as dystonia 18 [DYT18]) and paroxysmal choreoathetosis with spasticity (previously known as dystonia 9 [DYT9]), atypical childhood absence epilepsy, myoclonic astatic epilepsy, and paroxysmal non- epileptic findings including intermittent ataxia, choreoathetosis, dystonia, and alternating hemiplegia. The classic phenotype is characterized by infantile-onset seizures, delayed neurologic development, acquired microcephaly, and complex movement disorders. Seizures in classic early-onset Glut1 DS begin before age six months. Several seizure types occur: generalized tonic or clonic, focal, myoclonic, atypical absence, atonic, and unclassified. In some infants, apneic episodes and abnormal episodic eye-head movements similar to opsoclonus may precede the onset of seizures. The frequency, severity, and type of seizures vary among affected individuals and are not related to disease severity. Cognitive impairment, ranging from learning disabilities to severe intellectual disability, is typical. The complex movement disorder, characterized by ataxia, dystonia, and chorea, may occur in any combination and may be continuous, paroxysmal, or continual with fluctuations in severity influenced by environmental factors such as fasting or with infectious stress. Symptoms often improve substantially when a ketogenic diet is started. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of Glut1 DS is established in a proband with suggestive clinical findings, normal blood glucose concentration, CSF glucose concentration <60 mg/dL, and the identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant (or rarely, biallelic pathogenic variants) in SLC2A1 by molecular genetic testing. If no pathogenic variant is identified, 3-O-methyl-D-glucose uptake in erythrocytes can be performed; results between 35% and 74% of controls are diagnostic.

Management GeneReviews Treatment of manifestations: The ketogenic diet is highly effective in controlling the seizures and improving gait disturbance and is generally well tolerated. Affected individuals treated effectively at a younger age have a better outcome The ketogenic diet is deficient in L-carnitine necessitating dietary supplementation. Prevention of primary manifestations: Early diagnosis and treatment with a ketogenic diet is associated with improved neurologic outcome. Prevention of secondary complications: For those on a ketogenic diet: L-carnitine supplementation; proper hydration and avoidance of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors; avoidance of carbohydrate-containing foods, intravenous fluids, and medications that interrupt the state of ketosis; avoidance of valproic acid because it increases the risk of a Reye-like illness. Surveillance: Periodic measurement of blood ketone concentration with a target beta-hydroxybutyrate concentration of 3-5 mmol/L. Agents to avoid: Barbiturates (e.g., phenobarbital, the antiepileptic drug most commonly used in treating infants), methylxanthines (e.g., caffeine), valproic acid. Evaluation of relatives at risk: If the pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, it is appropriate to test at-risk newborns, infants, and other relatives at risk in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from initiation of treatment and preventive measures. Genetic counseling Glut1 DS is most commonly inherited in an autosomal dominant (AD) manner. About 90% of individuals with AD Glut1 DS have the disorder as the result of a de novo heterozygous pathogenic variant; about 10% have a clinically affected parent. Parents who are heterozygous for the pathogenic variant may have a mild phenotype or be asymptomatic, findings that can suggest mosaicism in the parent. Offspring of an individual with AD Glut1 DS have a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant and being clinically affected. Rarely, Glut1 DS is inherited in an autosomal recessive (AR) manner. Heterozygotes (carriers) in families with AR Glut1 DS are asymptomatic. Once the SLC2A1 pathogenic variant(s) have been identified in an affected family member, prenatal diagnosis for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing for Glut1 DS are possible."

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics The phenotypic spectrum of untreated glutaric acidemia type 1 (GA-1) ranges from the more common form (infantile-onset disease) to the less common form (later-onset disease i.e., after age 6 years). Of note, the GA-1 phenotype can vary widely between untreated family members with the same genotype, primarily as a function of the age at which the first acute encephalopathic crisis occurred: three months to six years in infantile-onset GA-1 and after age six years in later-onset GA-1. Characteristically these crises result in acute bilateral striatal injury and subsequent complex movement disorders. In the era of newborn screening (NBS), the prompt initiation of treatment of asymptomatic infants detected by NBS means that most individuals who would have developed manifestations of either infantile-onset or later-onset GA-1 remain asymptomatic; however, they may be at increased risk for other manifestations (e.g., renal disease) that are becoming apparent as the understanding of the natural history of treated GA-1 continues to evolve. Diagnosis/testing Because the early initiation of treatment dramatically improved the outcome for persons with GA-1, an international guideline group has recommended NBS. The diagnosis of GA-1 in a proband with a positive NBS result or suggestive biochemical and/or clinical findings is confirmed by identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in GCDH or, when molecular genetic test results are uncertain, by detection of significantly reduced activity of the enzyme glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase (GCDH) in cultured fibroblasts or leukocytes. Management Prevention of primary manifestations: When GA-1 is suspected during the diagnostic evaluation of a newborn with an elevated concentration of 3-OH-GA in plasma or urine, metabolic treatment should be initiated immediately.

The main principles of treatment are to reduce lysine oxidation and enhance physiologic detoxification of glutaryl-CoA. Combined metabolic therapy includes low-lysine diet, carnitine supplementation, and emergency treatment during episodes with the goal of averting catabolism and minimizing CNS exposure to lysine and its toxic metabolic byproducts. Surveillance: Regular evaluations by a metabolic specialist and metabolic dietician; routine evaluation of growth parameters and head circumference, developmental progress and educational needs, clinical signs and symptoms of movement disorders, biochemical parameters, and renal function (in adolescents and adults). Agents/circumstances to avoid: Excessive dietary protein or protein malnutrition inducing catabolic state, prolonged fasting, catabolic illness (intercurrent infection; brief febrile illness post vaccination), inadequate caloric provision during other stressors (e.g., surgery or procedure requiring fasting/anesthesia). Evaluation of relatives at risk: Testing of all at-risk sibs of any age to allow for early diagnosis and treatment. For at-risk newborn sibs when prenatal testing was not performed: in parallel with NBS either test for the familial GCDH pathogenic variants or measure urine organic acids, plasma amino acids, and acylcarnitine profile.

The phenotype of GM1 gangliosidosis constitutes a spectrum ranging from severe (infantile) to intermediate (late-infantile and juvenile) to mild (chronic/adult). Type I (infantile) GM1 gangliosidosis begins before age 12 months. Prenatal manifestations may include nonimmune hydrops fetalis, intrauterine growth restriction, and placental vacuolization; congenital dermal melanocytosis (Mongolian spots) may be observed. Macular cherry-red spot is detected on eye exam. Progressive central nervous system dysfunction leads to spasticity and rapid regression; blindness, deafness, decerebrate rigidity, seizures, feeding difficulties, and oral secretions are observed. Life expectancy is two to three years. Type II can be subdivided into the late-infantile (onset age 1-3 years) and juvenile (onset age 3-10 years) phenotypes. Central nervous system dysfunction manifests as progressive cognitive, motor, and speech decline as measured by psychometric testing. There may be mild corneal clouding, hepatosplenomegaly, and/or cardiomyopathy; the typical course is characterized by progressive neurologic decline, progressive skeletal disease in some individuals (including kyphosis and avascular necrosis of the femoral heads), and progressive feeding difficulties leading to aspiration risk. Type III begins in late childhood to the third decade with generalized dystonia leading to unsteady gait and speech disturbance followed by extrapyramidal signs including akinetic-rigid parkinsonism. Cardiomyopathy develops in some and skeletal involvement occurs in most. Intellectual impairment is common late in the disease with prognosis directly related to the degree of neurologic impairment.

Over time, affected individuals experience severe-to-profound developmental delay and intellectual disability, can develop dystonia with hyperkinetic movements, and may develop pigmentary skin changes of the hands and feet. Affected individuals often have frequent ear infections and pneumonia without evidence of immune dysfunction. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of GM3 synthase deficiency is established in a proband with suggestive findings and biallelic pathogenic variants in ST3GAL5 identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Treatment for new-onset or worsening irritability is based on identification of inciting factors; for example, motility agents for constipation, antibiotic treatment of infections, and standard therapies for GERD, such as proton pump inhibitors. Seizures are treated with anti-seizure medication (ASM), although the majority of electrographic seizures in affected children are clinically silent. No ASM has been demonstrated effective for this condition specifically, ASM treatment may be only partially effective, and multiple ASMs may be required. Feeding therapy may be useful, with consideration of gastrostomy tube placement for persistent poor feeding / growth failure. Hearing aids may be helpful on a case-by-case basis. There is no specific treatment for optic atrophy or cortical blindness, although referral to low vision services is recommended.

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics DYT-GNAL caused by a heterozygous GNAL pathogenic variant has been reported in more than 60 individuals to date. It is characterized by adult-onset isolated dystonia (i.e., no neurologic abnormalities other than tremor are evident on neurologic examination). The dystonia is most commonly focal and segmental, and rarely generalized. Dystonia is typically cervical in onset and commonly progresses to the cranial region (oromandibular/jaw, larynx, eyelids) and/or to one arm. Tremor reported in DYT-GNAL may be dystonic (i.e., occurring in a body part that shows at least minimal signs of dystonia) and may precede or follow the onset of dystonia. Intra- and interfamilial variability is considerable. DYT-GNAL caused by biallelic GNAL pathogenic variants, reported to date in two sibs from a consanguineous family, is characterized by mild intellectual disability and childhood-onset hypertonia that progresses to generalized dystonia. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of DYT-GNAL is established in a proband with either isolated dystonia and a heterozygous GNAL pathogenic variant identified by molecular genetic testing or a more complex phenotype (intellectual disability, hypertonia, and generalized dystonia) and biallelic GNAL pathogenic variants. Management Treatment of manifestations: While oral medication is usually the initial treatment of dystonia, experience in DYT-GNAL specifically is limited. Botulinum toxin intramuscular injections have improved cervical dystonia and dystonia affecting other sites in some patients with DYT-GNAL as well as dystonia in selected muscles in patients with generalized dystonia. Deep-brain stimulation of the globus pallidus internus has been effective in a few patients with DYT-GNAL. Physical therapy may help prevent joint contractures and spine deformities. Treatment of depression and anxiety, commonly associated with cervical dystonia, is per standard practice.

GeneReviews Surveillance: Follow up with a neurologist specializing in movement disorders several times a year is recommended to monitor for worsening of dystonia, development of new manifestations, and treatment effectiveness and side effects. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Dystonia of limbs can worsen if affected limbs are casted or braced. Similarly, neck collars should be avoided in persons with cervical dystonia. Genetic counseling DYT-GNAL is typically inherited in an autosomal dominant manner (to date, 1 family with autosomal recessive inheritance of DYT-GNAL has been reported). Most individuals with autosomal dominant DYT-GNAL have an affected parent; the proportion of DYT-GNAL caused by a de novo pathogenic variant is unknown. Each child of an individual with DYT-GNAL has a 50% chance of inheriting the GNAL pathogenic variant; reduced penetrance and large intrafamilial clinical variability have been reported. Once the GNAL pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic diagnosis are possible."

PHP-Ia and PHP-Ic are characterized by: End-organ resistance to endocrine hormones including parathyroid hormone (PTH), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), gonadotropins (LH and FSH), growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH), and CNS neurotransmitters (leading to obesity and variable degrees of intellectual disability and developmental delay); and The Albright hereditary osteodystrophy (AHO) phenotype (short stature, round facies, and subcutaneous ossifications) and brachydactyly type E (shortening mainly of the 4th and/or 5th metacarpals and metatarsals and distal phalanx of the thumb). Although PHP-Ib is characterized principally by PTH resistance, some individuals also have partial TSH resistance and mild features of AHO (e.g., brachydactyly). PPHP, a more limited form of PHP-Ia, is characterized by various manifestations of the AHO phenotype without the hormone resistance or obesity. POH and OC are even more restricted variants of PPHP: POH consists of dermal ossification beginning in infancy, followed by increasing and extensive bone formation in deep muscle and fascia. OC consists of extra-skeletal ossification that is limited to the dermis and subcutaneous tissues.

Diagnosis/testing GeneReviews The diagnosis of a disorder of GNAS inactivation is established in a proband with all or some of the characteristic clinical and endocrine findings and evidence on molecular genetic testing of a genetic or epigenetic alteration resulting in lack of expression/function of the GNAS complex locus. PHP-Ia,.-Ib, and -Ic are associated with reduced or absent expression/function of the protein Gs (encoded by the maternal GNAS complex locus) due to one of the following: An inactivating GNAS pathogenic variant A genetic alteration in the imprinting regulatory elements in the GNAS complex locus or the nearby gene, STX16, that prevents proper maternal imprint of the GNAS complex locus Isolated epimutations Paternal 20q disomy PPHP and POH/OC phenotypes are associated with lack of expression/function of Gs encoded by the paternal GNAS allele due to an inactivating GNAS pathogenic variant; the POH/OC phenotypes are also associated with lack of expression/function of Gs (encoded by the maternal GNAS allele) as a result of an inactivating GNAS pathogenic variant. Management Treatment of manifestations: Deficiencies of parathyroid hormone, thyroid hormone, and gonadotropins due to hormone resistance are treated in a standard manner. Growth hormone replacement therapy should be considered if screening for growth hormone deficiency with appropriate provocative testing is abnormal. Subcutaneous ossifications that are superficial and well circumscribed may be surgically removed when they are large or cause local irritation, although they may recur. Obesity tends to be the most difficult manifestation to treat as individuals with PHP-Ia and PHP-Ic have decreased resting energy expenditure and hyperphagia; thus, the usual recommendation of reduced caloric intake and increased physical activity may be less successful than in persons with obesity from other causes. Surveillance: Routine monitoring of: Endocrine function: measurement of serum concentration of PTH, calcium and phosphate, TSH and free T4, and urinary calcium excretion; Growth velocity and growth hormone status (serum IGF1 and/or stimulated growth hormone testing); New and/or enlarging ectopic ossifications; Development of and/or progression of cataracts; and Psychoeducational needs regarding school assistance / educational support and developmental therapies (e.g., physical, occupational, and speech therapy). Agents/circumstances to avoid: Limit dietary intake of phosphorus (dairy products and meats) in persons with persistently elevated serum levels of phosphate. Evaluation of relatives at risk: It is appropriate to evaluate apparently asymptomatic first-degree relatives of an affected individual in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from prompt initiation of treatment. Pregnancy management: For women with a disorder of GNAS inactivation that affects the maternal allele: Monitoring of serum concentration of calcium and thyroid studies (TSH, free T4) throughout pregnancy, labor, and the postpartum period and supplementation of calcium, vitamin D, and thyroid hormone as needed. of GNAS Inactivation 3 Genetic counseling Disorders of GNAS inactivation are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner with the specific phenotype determined by the parental origin of the defective allele. Of individuals with a disorder of GNAS inactivation, approximately 38% have an affected parent and 38% have a de novo GNAS pathogenic variant; in the remaining approximately 25% the cause is unknown. Each child of an individual with a disorder of GNAS inactivation has a 50% chance of inheriting the parent's genetic alteration (except for simplex cases with PHP-1b for whom the mode of inheritance is not well established). If the maternal GNAS complex locus is affected, her offspring are at risk for PHP-Ia, PHP-Ib (when associated with deletions at the imprinting regulatory elements), or PHP-Ic; if the paternal allele has an inactivating GNAS pathogenic variant, his offspring are at risk for PPHP or POH/OC. If the genetic alteration in the GNAS complex locus or the GNAS pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are technically possible."

Intellect ranges from normal to profoundly impaired. Observed speech disorders include dysarthria and speech dyspraxia, and both receptive and expressive language delays; more mildly affected individuals may display subtly impaired intelligibility of conversational speech. Epilepsy features include seizure onset usually between ages three and six years, focal epilepsy with language and/or global developmental regression, and electroencephalogram (EEG) abnormalities, including continuous spike-and-wave discharges in sleep or very active centrotemporal discharges. Epilepsy is typically focal and ranges from self-limited epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes to developmental and/or epileptic encephalopathies (DEE/EE), including the syndromes of DEE/EE with spike-wave activation in sleep (DEE/EE-SWAS), which include Landau-Kleffner syndrome.

Offspring of affected individuals have a 50% chance of inheriting the 22q11.2 deletion. Once the 22q11.2 deletion has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing using FISH, MLPA, or array studies for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible."

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Phelan-McDermid syndrome-SHANK3 related (PMS-SHANK3 related) is characterized by neonatal hypotonia, absent to severely delayed speech, developmental delay, and minor dysmorphic facial features. Most affected individuals have moderate-to-profound intellectual disability. Other features include relatively large fleshy hands, dysplastic toenails, and decreased perspiration that results in a tendency to overheat. Normal stature and normal head size distinguish PMS-SHANK3 related from other autosomal chromosome disorders. Neurobehavioral characteristics include mouthing or chewing non-food items, decreased perception of pain, and autism spectrum disorder or autistic-like affect and behavior. Some individuals experience regression / loss of skills, epilepsy, ataxic/abnormal gait, and sleep disturbance (difficulty falling asleep and staying asleep, hypersomnia, and parasomnias). Less commonly, affected individuals may have strabismus, vision problems (hyperopia or myopia), cardiac anomalies, renal anomalies, and lymphedema. Those who have PMS-SHANK3 related due to a ring chromosome 22 also have a high risk of developing features of NF2-related schwannomatosis (NF2). Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of PMS-SHANK3 related is established in a proband with suggestive findings and either (1) a <50- kb to >9-Mb heterozygous deletion at chromosome 22q13.3 with involvement of at least part of SHANK3; (2) a heterozygous pathogenic variant in SHANK3; OR (3) a chromosomal rearrangement with breakpoints disrupting SHANK3 identified by molecular genetic testing.

Those who experience poor feeding may benefit from feeding therapy or, if the feeding issues are persistent, placement of a gastrostomy tube. Immunomodulation therapy (such as intravenous immunoglobulins) may be considered in those with autoimmune encephalitis. Sleep hygiene, healthy habits, light therapy, and potential medical management may be considered to treat sleep disturbance. More complex vision issues, such as optic nerve hypoplasia or cortical visual impairment, may require input from an ophthalmic subspecialist. Use of pressure stockings and elevation of the foot of the bed may be helpful for those who have lymphedema; depending on the stage of the symptom, compression therapy, weight reduction, and stimulation mobility may also be indicated. In those who have a ring chromosome 22, see the GeneReview on NF2-related schwannomatosis for further information about treatment of manifestations. Surveillance: At each visit, measurement of growth parameters; evaluation of nutritional status and safety of oral intake; monitor for signs/symptoms of GERD; monitor for new manifestations, such as seizures, changes in tone, and developmental regression; monitor developmental progress and educational needs; evaluate for neurobehavioral issues, such as anxiety, ADHD, autism, aggression, and self-injury; monitor for signs/symptoms of sleep apnea and sleep disturbance. Annually, perform audiology evaluation and ophthalmology evaluation. At each visit in childhood and adolescence, monitor for signs and progression of puberty. At regular intervals, perform dental evaluation for evidence of tooth decay, malocclusion, and crowding. In those with poor growth or as clinically indicated, assess thyroid function. In those with a ring chromosome 22, perform annual neurologic examination by a provider with experience with NF2; brain MRI annually beginning at age 10-12 years until fourth decade of life; annual audiology evaluation, including BAER, to assess for the earliest symptoms of vestibular schwannomas; annual ophthalmology evaluation. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Exposure to high temperatures and extended periods in the sun due to reduced perspiration and tendency to overheat easily; exposure to excessive heat or cold, sharp objects, or clothes/shoes that may be too tight and cause skin lesions due to decreased perception of pain; radiotherapy for NF2- associated tumors in those with a ring chromosome 22. Genetic counseling PMS-SHANK3 related is an autosomal dominant disorder most often caused by a de novo genetic alteration. Recurrence risk in family members depends on the genetic mechanism underlying PMS-SHANK3 in the proband and the genetic status of the parents of the proband. 22q13.3 deletion: Most probands have a de novo deletion; some probands have the deletion as the result of an unbalanced structural rearrangement that includes 22q13 (about half of these individuals have a parent who is a carrier of a balanced translocation) or a ring chromosome 22 (karyotype screening of the proband for a ring chromosome 22 must be done if a terminal 22q13.3 deletion is detected by CMA). Rarely, a proband inherited the genetic alteration from a heterozygous or mosaic parent. If a parent has (1) a non-mosaic 22q13.3 deletion, the risk to each sib of inheriting the deletion is 50%; (2) a mosaic 22q13.3 deletion, the risk to each sib is increased but impossible to quantify because the level of mosaicism in gonadal tissue is unknown; (3) a chromosomal rearrangement, the risk to sibs is increased and depends on the specific chromosomal rearrangement and the possibility of other variables. Intragenic SHANK3 pathogenic variant: Most probands have a de novo pathogenic variant; rarely, a proband inherited the pathogenic variant from a heterozygous or mosaic parent. If a parent of the proband is affected and/or known to have an intragenic SHANK3 pathogenic variant, the risk to the sibs is 50%. Once a 22q13.3 deletion involving SHANK3 or a SHANK3 intragenic pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing are possible. Prenatal test results cannot reliably predict the phenotype. Syndrome-SHANK3 Related 3"

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Glycogen storage disease type I (GSD I) is characterized by accumulation of glycogen and fat in the liver and kidneys resulting in hepatomegaly and nephromegaly. Severely affected infants present in the neonatal period with severe hypoglycemia due to fasting intolerance. More commonly, untreated infants present at age three to four months with hepatomegaly, severe hypoglycemia with or without seizures, lactic acidosis, hyperuricemia, and hypertriglyceridemia. Affected children typically have doll-like faces with full cheeks, relatively thin extremities, short stature, and a protuberant abdomen. Xanthoma and diarrhea may be present. Impaired platelet function and development of reduced or dysfunctional von Willebrand factor can lead to a bleeding tendency with frequent epistaxis and menorrhagia in females. Individuals with untreated GSD Ib are more likely to develop impaired neutrophil and monocyte function as well as chronic neutropenia resulting in recurrent bacterial infections, gingivitis, periodontitis, and genital and intestinal ulcers. Long-term complications of untreated GSD I include short stature, osteoporosis, delayed puberty, renal disease (including proximal and distal renal tubular acidosis, renal stones, and kidney failure), gout, systemic hypertension, pulmonary hypertension, hepatic adenomas with potential for malignancy, pancreatitis, and polycystic ovaries. Seizures and cognitive impairment may occur in individuals with prolonged periods of hypoglycemia. Normal growth and puberty are expected in treated children. Most affected individuals live into adulthood. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of GSD I is established in a proband by identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in either G6PC1 (GSD Ia) or SLC37A4 (GSD Ib). If molecular genetic testing is inconclusive, hepatic enzyme activity analysis is only available for glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic activity (GSD Ia).

Bone density every one to two years and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D annually; renal ultrasound annually beginning at age ten years; blood pressure at each visit; developmental assessment as indicated; evaluation by a gastroenterologist when indicated; colonoscopy when indicated. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Avoid sucrose, galactose, fructose, high fructose corn syrup, honey, maple syrup, molasses, agave nectar, and sorbitol. Combined oral contraception (including high-dose estrogen) should be avoided in women, particularly those with adenomas. Metformin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, and lactate- containing infusions such as Ringers lactate should be avoided. Glucagon should not be used to treat hypoglycemia. Evaluation of relatives at risk: Molecular genetic testing (if the family-specific pathogenic variants are known) and/or evaluation by a metabolic physician soon after birth (if the family-specific pathogenic variants are not known) allows for early diagnosis and treatment of sibs at risk for GSD I.

Infantile-onset Pompe disease (IOPD; individuals with onset before age 12 months with cardiomyopathy) may be apparent in utero but more typically onset is at the median age of four months with hypotonia, generalized muscle weakness, feeding difficulties, failure to thrive, respiratory distress, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Without treatment by enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), IOPD commonly results in death by age two years from progressive left ventricular outflow obstruction and respiratory insufficiency. Late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD; including: (a) individuals with onset before age 12 months without cardiomyopathy; and (b) all individuals with onset after age 12 months) is characterized by proximal muscle weakness and respiratory insufficiency; clinically significant cardiac involvement is uncommon. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of GSD II is established in a proband with either deficiency of acid alpha-glucosidase enzyme activity or biallelic pathogenic variants in GAA on molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Management guidelines from the American College of Medical Genetics: individualized care of cardiomyopathy as standard drugs may be contraindicated and risk for tachyarrhythmia and sudden death is high; physical therapy for muscle weakness to maintain range of motion and assist in ambulation; surgery for contractures as needed; nutrition/feeding support. Respiratory support may include inspiratory/expiratory training in affected adults, CPAP, BiPAP, and/or tracheostomy.

Surveillance: Routine monitoring of respiratory status, cardiovascular status, musculoskeletal function (including bone densitometry), nutrition and feeding, kidney function, and hearing. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Digoxin, ionotropes, diuretics, and afterload-reducing agents, as they may worsen left ventricular outflow obstruction in some stages of the disease; hypotension and volume depletion; exposure to infectious agents. Evaluation of relatives at risk: Evaluate at-risk sibs to permit early diagnosis and treatment with ERT. Genetic counseling Pompe disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner.

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Glycogen storage disease type III (GSD III) is characterized by variable liver, cardiac muscle, and skeletal muscle involvement. GSD IIIa is the most common subtype, present in about 85% of affected individuals; it manifests with liver and muscle involvement. GSD IIIb, with liver involvement only, comprises about 15% of all affected individuals. In infancy and early childhood, liver involvement presents as hepatomegaly and failure to thrive, with fasting ketotic hypoglycemia, hyperlipidemia, and elevated hepatic transaminases. In adolescence and adulthood, liver disease becomes less prominent. Most individuals develop cardiac involvement with cardiac hypertrophy and/or cardiomyopathy. Skeletal myopathy manifesting as weakness may be evident in childhood and slowly progresses, typically becoming prominent in the third to fourth decade. The overall prognosis is favorable but cannot be predicted on an individual basis. Long-term complications such as muscular and cardiac symptoms as well as liver fibrosis/cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma may have a severe impact on prognosis and quality of life. To date, it is unknown if long-term complications can be alleviated and/or avoided by dietary interventions. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of GSD III is established in a proband by identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in AGL. If molecular genetic testing is inconclusive, debranching enzyme activity can be measured in either blood cells (leukocytes or erythrocytes), skin fibroblasts, or liver or muscle biopsy.

Management GeneReviews Treatment of manifestations: Dietary management tailored to the individual patient remains the primary therapy. Frequent feeds (every 3-4 hours) are needed to maintain euglycemia in infancy. Toward the end of the first year of life, several doses per day (~1 g/kg) of cornstarch may be required to avoid hypoglycemia. Protein intake of 3 g/kg is recommended; extra protein supplementation may be needed. For those with night-time hypoglycemia, Glycosade extended-release cornstarch or continuous nocturnal drip-feeding can be used. Titration of dietary protein and cornstarch is based on self-monitored capillary blood glucose and ketone concentrations, to maintain euglycemia and to prevent ketosis, hypercholesterolemia, and hypertriglyceridemia. Maltodextrin or rapidly absorbable carbohydrates prior to exercise to prevent hypoglycemia during physical activity; oral fructose and sucrose ingestion to improve exercise tolerance. High-fat diet to reduce cardiomyopathy can be considered. Up-to-date individualized emergency letters; perioperative glucose infusion for surgeries to prevent hypoglycemia. Liver transplantation is reserved for those with severe hepatic cirrhosis, liver dysfunction, and/or hepatocellular carcinoma. Liver transplantation may exacerbate myopathy and cardiomyopathy. Vitamin D and calcium supplementation to prevent osteoporosis. Surveillance: Aspartate aminotransferase, alanine transaminase, liver function as needed (e.g., albumin, bilirubin, ammonia, and clotting studies), creatine kinase (CK), lipid profile every six to 12 months, liver ultrasound every six to 12 months in children and every 12 to 24 months in adults, liver MRI as needed. To identify periods of suboptimal metabolic control, measured preprandial blood glucose and blood ketones or urine ketones on waking. Neurologic, physical therapy, and musculoskeletal assessments; NT-proBNP, CK-MB, electrocardiogram, and echocardiogram every 12 to 24 months in those with GSD IIIa, and every five years in those with GSD IIIb; measurement of height, weight, body mass index, head circumference, and assessment of diet and exercise as needed based on age; serum calcium and 25(OH)-vitamin D annually; regular bone density measurement is recommended. Agents/circumstances to avoid: High carbohydrate intake, steroid-based drugs, growth hormone replacement therapy, medications that can cause rhabdomyolysis. Use with caution: hormonal contraceptives, statins for control of hyperlipidemia, and beta blockers. Evaluation of relatives at risk: Diagnosis of at-risk sibs at birth allows for early dietary intervention to prevent hypoglycemia. Pregnancy management: Increased monitoring and support during pregnancy of women with GSD III because of increased glucose needs during pregnancy. Although gestational diabetes can occur, oral glucose tests are not indicated. Glucose infusion and regular monitoring of blood glucose, ketones, blood gases, and CK is necessary during labor and perinatally to prevent ketonuria and risk of hyperketosis, metabolic acidosis, and acute rhabdomyolysis. Glucose management requires balancing undertreatment against the risks assocated with overtreatment (e.g., fetal hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia). Genetic counseling GSD III is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. If both parents are known to be heterozygous for an AGL pathogenic variant, each sib of an affected individual has at conception a 25% chance of being affected with GSD III, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of inheriting neither of the familial AGL pathogenic variants. Once the AGL pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member, carrier testing for at-risk family members and prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing for a pregnancy at increased risk are possible.

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Glycogen storage disease type V (GSDV, McArdle disease) is a metabolic myopathy characterized by exercise intolerance manifested by rapid fatigue, myalgia, and cramps in exercising muscles. Symptoms are usually precipitated by isometric exercise or sustained aerobic exercise. Most individuals improve their exercise tolerance by exploiting the \\\"second-wind\\\" phenomenon with relief of myalgia and fatigue after a few minutes of rest. Age of onset is frequently in the first decade of life but can vary; however, diagnosis is typically delayed as myalgia and fatigability are dismissed/overlooked. Fixed muscle weakness occurs in approximately 25% of affected individuals, is more likely to involve proximal muscles, and is more common in individuals of advanced age. Approximately 50% of affected individuals have recurrent episodes of myoglobinuria that can on occasion eventually result in acute renal failure. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of GSDV is established in a proband with suggestive findings and by identification of biallelic PYGM (encoding glycogen phosphorylase, muscle form) pathogenic variants on molecular genetic testing or if genetic test results are not diagnostic by assay of muscle myophosphorylase enzyme activity. Management Treatment of manifestations: Although no cure for GSDV is available, affected individuals benefit from moderate-intensity aerobic training (e.g., walking or brisk walking, bicycling) to increase cardiorespiratory fitness and muscle oxidative capacity. Pre-exercise ingestion of sports drinks containing simple carbohydrates improves exercise tolerance and may protect against exercise-induced rhabdomyolysis.

Muscle PhK deficiency. Regular evaluation by a metabolic physician, a metabolic nutritionist, and a physical therapist. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Liver PhK deficiency. Large amounts of simple sugars as they will increase liver storage of glycogen; prolonged fasting; high-impact contact sports if significant hepatomegaly is present; drugs known to cause hypoglycemia such as insulin and insulin secretagogues (the sulfonylureas) or drugs known to mask symptoms of hypoglycemia such as beta-blockers; alcohol (which may predispose to hypoglycemia). Muscle PhK deficiency. Vigorous exercise; medications like succinylcholine and statins that can cause rhabdomyolysis. Evaluation of relatives at risk: Molecular genetic testing (if the family-specific pathogenic variant[s] are known) and/or evaluation by a metabolic physician (if the family-specific pathogenic variant[s] are not known) allows early diagnosis and treatment for sibs at increased risk for GSD IX. Pregnancy management: Individualized dietary management is necessary to maintain euglycemia throughout pregnancy. Genetic counseling PHKA2-related liver PhK deficiency and PHKA1-related muscle PhK deficiency are inherited in an X-linked manner. PHKB-related liver and muscle PhK deficiency and PHKG2-related liver PhK deficiency are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. X-linked inheritance. If the mother of the proband has a pathogenic variant, the chance of transmitting it in each pregnancy is 50%. Males who inherit the pathogenic variant will be affected; females who inherit the pathogenic variant will be heterozygotes (carriers); the development of symptoms in individuals depends on the pattern of X-chromosome inactivation. Affected males pass the pathogenic variant to all of their daughters and none of their sons. Kinase Deficiency 3 Autosomal recessive inheritance. At conception, each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Carrier testing for at-risk relatives, prenatal testing for pregnancies at risk, and preimplantation genetic testing are possible if the pathogenic variant(s) in the family have been identified."

In the 47 affected individuals reported to date, predominant findings were intellectual disability (ranging from mild to profound) and behavioral issues (combinations of anxiety/phobias, obsessive behaviors, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and autistic spectrum disorder/traits among others). Skeletal involvement can include scoliosis and decreased bone mineral density. Other findings in some include seizures, craniosynostosis, and hearing loss. Life expectancy does not appear to be reduced in HIST1H1E syndrome. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of HIST1H1E syndrome is established in a proband with suggestive findings and a heterozygous pathogenic variant in H1-4 (formerly HIST1H1E) identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Management by multidisciplinary specialists is recommended, including but not limited to developmental pediatrics/behavioral psychology, neurosurgery/neurology, urology, cardiology, endocrinology, ophthalmology, orthopedics, and dentistry.

To date, all probands reported with HIST1H1E syndrome whose parents have undergone molecular genetic testing have the disorder as a result of a de novo H1-4 pathogenic variant. If the H1-4 pathogenic variant found in the proband cannot be detected in the leukocyte DNA of either parent, the recurrence risk to sibs is estimated to be 1% because of the theoretic possibility of parental germline mosaicism. Once the H1-4 pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing and preimplantation genetic testing are possible."

HPE spectrum disorder, resulting from failed or incomplete forebrain division early in gestation, includes alobar, semilobar, or lobar HPE. Other observed midline brain malformations include corpus callosum agenesis, absent septum pellucidum, absent olfactory bulbs and tracts, and vermian hypoplasia. Other findings associated with the HPE spectrum such as craniofacial dysmorphism, neurologic issues (developmental delay, spasticity, seizures, hypothalamic dysfunction), feeding problems, and endocrine issues (hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and central insipidus diabetes) are common. Ectrodactyly spectrum disorders are unilateral or bilateral malformations of the hands and/or feet characterized by a median cleft of hand or foot due to absence of the longitudinal central rays (also called split-hand/foot malformation). The number of digits on the right and left can vary. Polydactyly and syndactyly can also be seen. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of FGFR1-related Hartsfield syndrome is established in a proband with suggestive findings and either an FGFR1 heterozygous pathogenic variant (in those with autosomal dominant inheritance) or FGFR1 biallelic pathogenic variants (in those with autosomal recessive inheritance) identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Diabetes insipidus may require treatment with desmopressin; temperature dysregulation can be managed by modifying the environment; disturbance of sleep-wake cycles can be managed with good sleep hygiene and, if needed, use of melatonin or other sleep aids such as clonidine.

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Hereditary coproporphyria (HCP) is an acute (hepatic) porphyria in which the acute symptoms are neurovisceral and occur in discrete episodes. Attacks typically start in the abdomen with low-grade pain that slowly increases over a period of days (not hours) with nausea progressing to vomiting. In some individuals, the pain is predominantly in the back or extremities. When an acute attack is untreated, a motor neuropathy may develop over a period of days or a few weeks. The neuropathy first appears as weakness proximally in the arms and legs, then progresses distally to involve the hands and feet. Some individuals experience respiratory insufficiency due to loss of innervation of the diaphragm and muscles of respiration. Acute attacks are associated commonly with use of certain medications, caloric deprivation, and changes in female reproductive hormones. About 20% of those with an acute attack also experience photosensitivity associated with bullae and skin fragility. Diagnosis/testing The most sensitive and specific biochemical screening test for any one of the acute porphyrias (including HCP) during an acute attack is a striking increase in urinary porphobilinogen. Quantitative analysis of porphyrins in both urine and feces is essential to distinguish between the different acute porphyrias and establish the diagnosis of HCP. Identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in CPOX (encoding the enzyme coproporphyrinogen-III oxidase) confirms the diagnosis and enables family studies. Management Treatment of manifestations: Acute attacks are treated by discontinuation of any medications thought to induce attacks, management of dehydration and/or hyponatremia, administration of carbohydrate, and infusion of hematin (Panhematin, Recordati Group). Individuals with more than four attacks per year have historically been at highest risk for developing chronic neurologic manifestations. Givosiran, an siRNA that works directly against ALAS1 and is effective in preventing acute attacks in such individuals, was approved in the US in Author Affiliations: 1 University of California San Francisco San Francisco, California; Email: bruce.wang@ucsf.edu. 2 University of California San Francisco San Francisco, California; Email: montgomery.bissell@ucsf.edu.

GeneReviews November 2019; however, its effectiveness remains to be determined with long-term study. Treatment of symptoms and complications, such as seizures, should be with medications known to be safe in acute porphyria (see www.drugs-porphyria.org). A minority of affected individuals experience repeat acute attacks, in which case management strategies include suppression of ovulation in females, prophylactic use of hematin, and liver transplantation when attacks and neurologic complications persist despite multiple courses of hematin. Treatment of chronic (cutaneous) manifestations is through avoidance of sun/light, including wearing protective clothing and using protective tinted glass for cars and windows to prevent exposure to blue light. Prevention of primary manifestations: Agents or circumstances that may trigger an acute attack (including use of oral contraception and progestins in women) are avoided. Suppression of menses using a GnRH agonist (leuprolide, nafarelin, and others) may help CPOX heterozygotes who experience monthly exacerbations. Menopausal symptoms may occur as a side effect of GnRH agonists and can be treated with a low dose of estrogen. In CPOX heterozygotes undergoing surgery, minimize preoperative fasting and provide intravenous glucose in the perioperative period. Anesthesia induction using non-barbiturate agents is recommended. Surveillance: Annual liver and kidney function in those with chronically elevated ALA levels and/or those older than age 60 years; assessment for liver fibrosis (transient elastography [FibroScan] or a blood-based test [FibroTest or FibroSure]); annual screening for hepatocellular carcinoma with abdominal imaging and serum alpha-fetoprotein in those older than age 60. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Fasting, use of oral contraception and progestins in females, and certain drugs including barbiturates and phenytoin. Evaluation of relatives at risk: If the family-specific CPOX pathogenic variant is known, clarification of the genetic status of relatives at risk allows early diagnosis of heterozygotes and education regarding how to avoid risk factors known to be associated with acute attacks. Genetic counseling HCP is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner with low penetrance. Most individuals with HCP have an affected parent; the proportion with a de novo pathogenic variant is unknown. Each child of an individual with HCP has a 50% chance of inheriting the CPOX pathogenic variant. Because of reduced penetrance, many individuals with a CPOX pathogenic variant have no signs or symptoms of HCP. Prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk is possible if the pathogenic variant in an affected family member is known."

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics The spectrum of CSF1R-related disorder ranges from early-onset disease (age <18 years) to late-onset disease (age 18 years). Early-onset disease is associated with hypotonia, delayed acquisition of developmental milestones, and non-neurologic manifestations (such as skeletal abnormalities); both early- and late-onset disease have similar neurodegenerative involvement. Most affected individuals eventually become bedridden with spasticity, rigidity, and loss of the ability to walk. They lose speech and voluntary movement and appear to be generally unaware of their surroundings. The last stage of disease progresses to a vegetative state with presence of primitive reflexes, such as visual and tactile grasp, mouth-opening reflex, and sucking reflex. Death most commonly results from pneumonia or other infections. About 500 individuals with CSF1R-related disorder have been reported to date. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of CSF1R-related disorder is established in a proband with suggestive findings and a heterozygous CSF1R pathogenic variant or biallelic CSF1R pathogenic variants identified by molecular genetic testing.

GeneReviews Surveillance: Monitoring of existing manifestations, the individual's response to supportive care, and the emergence of new manifestations as specified by the multidisciplinary care providers. Agents/circumstances to avoid: For individuals with gait problems and cognitive decline, sedatives, antipsychotics, and other medications that may decrease alertness and increase the risk of falling should be used cautiously. Genetic counseling Early-onset CSF1R-related disorder is typically caused by biallelic pathogenic variants and inherited in an autosomal recessive manner; rarely, early-onset CSF1R-related disorder may be caused by a heterozygous pathogenic variant. Late-onset CSF1R-related disorder is typically caused by a heterozygous pathogenic variant and inherited in an autosomal dominant manner; rarely, late-onset CSF1R-related disorder may be caused by biallelic CSF1R pathogenic variants. While biallelic pathogenic variants are usually associated with early-onset disease and heterozygous pathogenic variants are usually associated with late-onset disease, definitive prediction of phenotype based on CSF1R genotype is not possible at this time. Autosomal recessive inheritance: The parents of an individual with CSF1R-related disorder caused by biallelic pathogenic variants are presumed to be heterozygous for a CSF1R pathogenic variant. If both parents are known to be heterozygous for a pathogenic variant, each sib of an affected individual has at conception a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being heterozygous, and a 25% chance of inheriting neither of the familial CSF1R pathogenic variants. Sibs who inherit the same biallelic CSF1R pathogenic variants do not necessarily have the same clinical manifestations early in the disease course; however, in the end stage, all individuals with CSF1R- related disorder typically have devastating neurologic involvement. The heterozygous sibs of an individual with CSF1R-related disorder caused by biallelic pathogenic variants are typically asymptomatic. Autosomal dominant inheritance: Many individuals with CSF1R-related disorder caused by a heterozygous pathogenic variant have an affected parent. Some individuals with CSF1R-related disorder caused by a heterozygous pathogenic variant represent a simplex case; such individuals may have the disorder as the result of a pathogenic variant that occurred de novo in the proband; a pathogenic variant inherited from a mosaic parent; or a pathogenic variant inherited from an asymptomatic heterozygous parent. Each child of an individual with a heterozygous CSF1R pathogenic variant has a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant. Family members who are heterozygous for the same CSF1R pathogenic variant do not necessarily have the same clinical manifestations early in the disease course; however, in the end stage, all individuals with CSF1R-related disorder typically have devastating neurologic involvement. Once the CSF1R pathogenic variant(s) have been identified in an affected family member, predictive testing for at-risk relatives and prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing for CSF1R-related disorder are possible."

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Hemophilia A is characterized by deficiency in factor VIII clotting activity that results in prolonged bleeding after injuries, tooth extractions, or surgery, and delayed or recurrent bleeding prior to complete wound healing. The age of diagnosis and frequency of bleeding episodes are related to the level of factor VIII clotting activity. Individuals with severe hemophilia A are usually diagnosed during the first two years of life following oral or soft tissue bleeding either with procedures or due to a known family history of hemophilia. Without prophylactic treatment, individuals may average up to two to five spontaneous bleeding episodes each month including spontaneous joint bleeds or deep-muscle hematomas, and prolonged bleeding or excessive pain and swelling from minor injuries, surgery, and tooth extractions. Individuals with moderate hemophilia A seldom have spontaneous bleeding, although it varies between individuals; however, they do have prolonged or delayed bleeding after relatively minor trauma and are usually diagnosed before age five to six years; the frequency of bleeding episodes varies, usually from once a month to once a year. Individuals with mild hemophilia A do not have spontaneous bleeding episodes; however, without pre- and postoperative treatment, abnormal bleeding occurs with surgery or tooth extractions; the frequency of bleeding episodes varies widely, typically from once a year to once every ten years. Individuals with mild hemophilia A are often not diagnosed until later in life. Approximately 30% of heterozygous females have factor VIII clotting activity below 40% and are at risk for bleeding (even if males in the family are only mildly affected). After major trauma or invasive procedures, prolonged or excessive bleeding usually occurs, regardless of severity.

Diagnosis/testing GeneReviews The diagnosis of hemophilia A is established in an individual with low factor VIII clotting activity in the presence of a normal, functional von Willebrand factor level. Identification of a hemizygous F8 pathogenic variant on molecular genetic testing in a male proband confirms the diagnosis. Identification of a heterozygous F8 pathogenic variant on molecular genetic testing in a symptomatic female confirms the diagnosis. Management Treatment of manifestations: Referral to a hemophilia treatment center (HTC) to facilitate treatment (intravenous infusion of factor VIII concentrate is most effective when infused within one hour of bleeding onset); training to facilitate home infusions administered by parents or affected individuals; immune tolerance therapy. For those with mild disease, immediate treatment of bleeding with intravenous or nasal desmopressin acetate in those who have been shown to respond to desmopressin acetate or factor VIII concentrate. Prevention of primary manifestations: For those with severe hemophilia A and those with moderate hemophilia A and frequent bleeding, prophylactic treatment with factor VIII concentrate infusions or subcutaneous administration of emicizumab. Adeno-associated viral (AAV)-mediated gene therapy for hemophilia A (valoctocogene roxaparvovec) was approved by the FDA for adults with severe disease in 2023. Surveillance: For individuals with severe or moderate hemophilia A, assessments including inhibitor screen every six to 12 months at an HTC; for individuals with mild hemophilia A, assessment at an HTC every one to two years. Comorbidities may require more frequent visits. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Circumcision of at-risk males until hemophilia A is either excluded or treated with factor VIII concentrate regardless of severity; activities with a high risk of trauma, particularly head injury; cautious, if any, use of medications and herbal remedies that affect platelet function, including aspirin. Use precaution with intramuscular injections (apply pressure; intramuscular injection may be scheduled after factor VIII treatment or while on emicizumab therapy). Evaluation of relatives at risk: It is appropriate to evaluate asymptomatic male and female at-risk relatives of an affected individual in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from prompt initiation of treatment, preventive measures, and surveillance. It is recommended that the genetic status of at-risk females be established prior to pregnancy or as early in a pregnancy as possible. Pregnancy management: Monitor affected females during pregnancy and for delayed bleeding post partum unless it is known that their baseline factor VIII clotting activity is normal prior to pregnancy and there are no symptoms of bleeding. Genetic counseling Hemophilia A is inherited in an X-linked manner. The risk to sibs of a male proband depends on the genetic status of the mother. The risk to sibs of a female proband depends on the genetic status of the mother and father. If the mother of the proband has an F8 pathogenic variant, the chance of the mother transmitting it in each pregnancy is 50%. If the father of the proband has an F8 pathogenic variant, he will transmit it to all his daughters and none of his sons. Males who inherit the pathogenic variant will be affected; females who inherit the pathogenic variant are heterozygotes and may be at risk for bleeding. Once the F8 pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, genetic testing for at-risk family members, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk, and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.

Identification of a hemizygous F9 pathogenic variant on molecular genetic testing in a male proband confirms the diagnosis. Identification of a heterozygous F9 pathogenic variant on molecular genetic testing in a female confirms the diagnosis. Management Treatment of manifestations: Referral to a hemophilia treatment center (HTC) for assessment, education, genetic counseling, and treatment. Targeted therapies: For those with severe disease, prophylactic infusions of factor IX concentrate to maintain factor IX clotting activity higher than 1% or as needed to prevent bleeding and allow normal activity improves outcomes and prevents chronic joint disease. Some individuals with moderate hemophilia bleed frequently enough to benefit from prophylaxis. Longer-acting products that allow weekly or biweekly dosing are now available. Intravenous infusion of plasma-derived or recombinant factor IX for acute bleeding episodes should be given as soon as possible after symptoms occur. Training in home infusion should be provided for individuals/families affected by moderate and severe hemophilia. Two products for adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated gene therapy for hemophilia B are now approved for use in adult males with factor IX levels 2%. Most individuals who receive gene therapy for hemophilia B will have mild hemophilia following treatment, although levels vary widely. Supportive care: Physical therapy for evaluation and treatment of musculoskeletal disease; standard treatments for pain with help from a pain specialist as needed; standard treatments for transfusion-related infections contracted prior to virucidal treatment of plasma-derived concentrates. Surveillance: For young children with severe or moderate hemophilia B, assessments every six to 12 months at an HTC; older children and adults with severe or moderate hemophilia B benefit from at least annual assessment at an HTC; for individuals with mild hemophilia B, assessment at an HTC every one to two years. Individuals with comorbidities may require more frequent visits. The assessment should include a review of bleeding episodes, adjustment of treatment plans as needed, a joint and muscle evaluation, an inhibitor screen, viral testing if indicated, and a discussion of any other issues related to the individual's hemophilia B as well as family and community support. Screening for alloimmune inhibitors is performed after treatment with factor IX concentrates has been initiated and in any individual with a suboptimal clinical response to treatment. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Circumcision of at-risk males until hemophilia B is either excluded or treated with factor IX concentrate regardless of severity; activities with a high risk of trauma, particularly head injury; aspirin and all aspirin-containing products. Cautious use of other medications and herbal remedies that affect platelet function. Use precaution with intramuscular injections (apply pressure and ice; intramuscular injection may be scheduled after factor IX treatment or while on prophylaxis). Evaluation of relatives at risk: It is appropriate to evaluate asymptomatic male and female at-risk relatives of an affected individual in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from prompt initiation of targeted therapies, supportive care, and surveillance. It is recommended that the genetic status of at-risk females be established prior to pregnancy or as early in a pregnancy as possible. Pregnancy management: Maternal factor IX levels do not increase during pregnancy and heterozygous females may need factor IX infusion support for delivery and/or to treat or prevent postpartum hemorrhage. Heterozygous mothers should be monitored for delayed bleeding postpartum. Tranexamic acid can be used to prevent postpartum hemorrhage. Other: Vitamin K does not prevent or control bleeding in hemophilia B. B 3 Genetic counseling Hemophilia B is inherited in an X-linked manner.

    "_id": "hemochromatosis",
    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics HFE-related hemochromatosis (HFE HC) is characterized by increased intestinal iron absorption and increased recycling of iron derived from senescent red blood cells. The phenotypic spectrum of HFE HC includes clinical HFE HC (increased serum ferritin and transferrin saturation and end-organ damage secondary to iron overload), biochemical HFE HC (increased serum ferritin and transferrin saturation without end-organ damage), and non-penetrant HFE HC (neither clinical manifestations of HFE HC nor iron overload are present, although elevated transferrin saturation may occur). Clinical HFE HC is characterized by excessive iron in the liver, pancreas, heart, skin, joints, and anterior pituitary gland. In untreated individuals, early manifestations include weakness, chronic fatigue, abdominal pain, weight loss, arthralgias, and diabetes mellitus. Individuals with HFE HC have an increased risk of cirrhosis when their serum ferritin is higher than 1,000 g/L. Other findings of severe iron overload include hypogonadism, congestive heart failure, arrhythmias, and progressive increase in skin pigmentation. Clinical HFE HC is more common in males than females. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of HFE HC is established in most persons with characteristic laboratory and/or clinical features by identification of HFE p.Cys282Tyr homozygosity. Management Targeted therapies: In individuals with clinical HFE HC, a major initial treatment goal is to remove excess iron by phlebotomy to achieve serum ferritin 50-100 g/L. Erythrocytapheresis is sometimes used to remove excess iron. Iron chelation therapy may be used to treat individuals intolerant of phlebotomy or erythrocytapheresis or those with symptomatic anemia. In individuals with biochemical HFE HC, phlebotomy is indicated when serum ferritin exceeds 300 g/L (males) and 200 g/L (females).

GeneReviews Treatment of manifestations: Management of complications of HFE HC (arthropathy, diabetes mellitus, cirrhosis, hypogonadism, and cardiomyopathy) do not differ from the management of these conditions in persons without HFE HC. Treatment of arthropathy includes nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, physiotherapy, and joint replacement. Standard treatment for diabetes mellitus. Vaccination for hepatitis A and B. Treatment of hepatitis B or C with standard antiviral agents may reduce liver injury. In individuals with cirrhosis, evaluation and treatment of complications is warranted, including endoscopic surveillance of varices; prophylaxis with nonselective beta-blockers; salt restriction and diuretics for ascites, with paracentesis and portosystemic shunts as needed; antibiotics to decrease risk of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis; and low-protein diet for hepatic encephalopathy with lactulose and rifaximin as indicated. Orthotopic liver transplant for end-stage liver disease. Hormone replacement therapy for hypogonadism; gonadotropins for infertility. Standard treatments for heart failure and arrhythmias in individuals with cardiomyopathy. Surveillance: In individuals with clinical HFE HC, after serum ferritin is 100 g/L, monitor serum ferritin concentration every three to four months, and maintain serum ferritin <300 g/L (males) and <200 g/L (females) thereafter; joint radiographs as needed; in those with diabetes mellitus assess for complications every six to 12 months; liver enzyme tests every six to 12 months; standard evaluations for primary liver cancer in those with cirrhosis; assessment for hormonal deficiency in those with hypogonadism; cardiac assessment in those with cardiac siderosis annually or as needed. In individuals with biochemical HFE HC and non-penetrant p.Cys282Tyr homozygotes, monitor serum ferritin concentration every six to 12 months, and begin phlebotomy to achieve iron depletion when serum ferritin exceeds 300 g/L (males) and 200 g/L (females). Agents/circumstances to avoid: Medicinal iron, mineral supplements containing iron, excess alcohol, excess vitamin C, uncooked seafood, and lifestyle behaviors that increase the risk of viral hepatitis infection; alcohol consumption should be avoided in those with hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis. Evaluation of relatives at risk: Offer molecular genetic testing to adult sibs of a proband to facilitate early diagnosis and surveillance. Genetic counseling HFE HC is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner and has low clinical penetrance. (Note: Pseudodominance has been observed in HFE HC and is attributed to the relatively high prevalence of p.Cys282Tyr heterozygotes in persons of European ancestry.) Most parents of individuals with HFE HC are p.Cys282Tyr heterozygotes (i.e., have one copy of HFE p.Cys282Tyr). On occasion, one parent has p.Cys282Tyr homozygosity and may have clinical, biochemical, or non-penetrant HFE HC. If both parents are p.Cys282Tyr heterozygotes, each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being homozygous for p.Cys282Tyr, a 50% chance of being heterozygous for p.Cys282Tyr, and a 25% chance of being neither homozygous nor heterozygous for p.Cys282Tyr. Sibs who are homozygous for p.Cys282Tyr are at risk for HFE-related iron overload, although the clinical penetrance of HFE HC is low."

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Hepatoerythropoietic porphyria (HEP) is characterized by blistering skin lesions, hypertrichosis, and scarring over the affected skin areas. Disease manifestations occur during infancy or childhood and with similar frequency in females and males. Mild anemia/hemolysis are not uncommon. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of HEP is established in a proband with elevated porphyrins in the urine (predominantly uroporphyrin and heptacarboxylporphyrin), significantly increased erythrocyte zinc protoporphyrin, and/or biallelic pathogenic (or likely pathogenic) variants in UROD identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: No treatment regimens can restore uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (UROD enzyme levels in individuals with HEP. The mainstays of therapy are avoidance of sunlight (including the long- wave ultraviolet light sunlight that passes through window glass) by use of protective clothing and topical application of opaque sunscreens. On sun-exposed areas of the skin, bullous lesions develop that require prompt management of resultant skin infections when appropriate. Phlebotomy and chloroquine, which are usually effective in treating the allelic disorder familial porphyria cutanea tarda, are generally ineffective in individuals with HEP. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Exposure to sunlight in persons of all ages. Older individuals should avoid known susceptibility factors: alcohol, oral estrogen, iron overload, smoking, and drugs that induce the cytochrome P450s.

Initial clinical manifestations can also include emesis, polyuria, polydipsia, constipation, diarrhea, decreased appetite, and episodes of dehydration. Electrolyte manifestations include hyperchloremic non-anion gap metabolic acidosis and hypokalemia. Renal complications of dRTA include nephrocalcinosis, nephrolithiasis, medullary cysts, and impaired renal function. Additional manifestations include bone demineralization (rickets, osteomalacia), growth deficiency, sensorineural hearing loss (in ATP6V0A4-, ATP6V1B1-, and FOXI1-dRTA), and hereditary hemolytic anemia (in some individuals with SLC4A1-dRTA).

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Following dietary exposure to fructose, sucrose, or sorbitol, untreated hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI) is characterized by metabolic disturbances (hypoglycemia, lactic acidemia, hypophosphatemia, hyperuricemia, hypermagnesemia, hyperalaninemia) and clinical findings (nausea, vomiting, and abdominal distress; chronic growth restriction / failure to thrive). While untreated HFI typically first manifested when fructose- and sucrose- containing foods were introduced in the course of weaning young infants from breast milk, it is now presenting earlier, due to the addition of fructose-containing nutrients in infant formulas. If the infant ingests large quantities of fructose, the infant may acutely develop lethargy, seizures, and/or progressive coma. Untreated HFI may result in renal and hepatic failure. If identified and treated before permanent organ injury occurs, individuals with HFI can experience a normal quality of life and life expectancy. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of HFI is established in a proband with suggestive metabolic disturbances and clinical findings following dietary exposure to fructose, sucrose, or sorbitol and either biallelic pathogenic variants in ALDOB identified on molecular genetic testing or now rarely deficient hepatic fructose 1-phosphate aldolase (aldolase B) activity on liver biopsy. Note: Fructose tolerance testing (\\\"fructose challenge\\\") in the diagnosis of HFI should be avoided because it is dangerous and, when used in the past, could result in death. Potential sources of fructose should be removed immediately if HFI is suspected. Management Treatment of manifestations: Acute manifestations (e.g., lethargy, seizures, or progressive coma and/or renal and hepatic failure) should be managed symptomatically in a hospital setting, including administration of intravenous glucose (dextrose), supportive treatment of hepatic and/or renal insufficiency, and treatment of metabolic acidosis, if present.

Copyright 1993-2024, University of Washington, Seattle. GeneReviews is a registered trademark of the University of Washington, Seattle. All rights reserved. GeneReviews Prevention of primary manifestations: Dietary restriction of fructose, sucrose, sucralose, and sorbitol is the cornerstone of HFI treatment. During hospitalizations, special caution is advised to avoid use of fructose- containing intravenous fluids, as well as fructose-containing infant formulas and pharmaceuticals. Given that reduced fruit and vegetable intake is a dietary requirement, daily supplementation with a \\\"sugar-free\\\" multivitamin is recommended to prevent micronutrient deficiencies, specifically water-soluble vitamins. Surveillance: No formal guidelines for surveillance exist. Once the diagnosis of HFI has been made, periodic evaluation of liver function, renal function, and growth is reasonable, particularly if compliance with the fructose/sucrose/sorbitol/sucralose-restricted diet is not absolute. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Enteral or parenteral exposure to fructose, sorbitol, sucrose, sucralose, and polysorbate, including fructose, fructose-containing oligosaccharides, high-fructose corn syrup, honey, agave syrup, inverted sugar, maple-flavored syrup, molasses, palm or coconut sugar, and sorghum. In addition, medicines and formulas in which fructose/sucrose may not be listed as a primary component need to be avoided; examples include syrups, enema solutions, some immunoglobulin solutions, and many infant and pediatric nutritional drinks. Although vaccinations are generally safe in children with HFI, the two potentially harmful vaccines are the sucrose-containing rotavirus vaccines, Rotarix pre-established oral suspension and RotaTeq, the only rotavirus vaccines approved for use in the US. Any individual with a severe adverse reaction immediately following administration of either vaccine should be thoroughly investigated for the possibility of HFI. Evaluation of relatives at risk: Presymptomatic diagnosis of HFI is warranted for sibs of a proband in order to avoid life-threatening complications by restricting fructose intake as soon as possible. Genetic counseling HFI is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. If both parents are known to be heterozygous for an ALDOB pathogenic variant, each sib of an affected individual has at conception a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being a carrier, and a 25% chance of inheriting neither pathogenic variant. Once the ALDOB pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member, carrier testing for at-risk relatives, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk, and preimplantation genetic testing are possible."

Scalp hair, eyelashes, and/or eyebrows are typically sparse. Muscle contractures are usually seen in childhood and can be present as early as age two years. The majority of affected individuals develop progressive weakness of the proximal and distal muscles of all four limbs. Some adults develop progressive interstitial pulmonary fibrosis, which can be life threatening within three to four years after respiratory symptoms appear. Other features are exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, liver impairment, hematologic abnormalities, relative short stature, and cataract.

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Diffuse gastric and lobular breast cancer syndrome (DGLBCS) is associated with an increased risk, in males and females, of diffuse gastric cancer (DGC), a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma (also referred to as signet ring cell carcinoma or isolated cell-type carcinoma) that infiltrates into the stomach wall, causing thickening of the wall (linitis plastica) without forming a distinct mass. In females with CDH1-related DGLBCS, but not in males, there is also an increased risk for lobular breast cancer (LBC), characterized by small, non-cohesive cells dispersed in the stroma or arranged in single-file infiltrating patterns. Cleft lip with or without cleft palate has also been reported in some individuals with CDH1-related DGLBCS. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of DGLBCS can be established in an individual with suggestive findings and a germline heterozygous pathogenic variant in CDH1 or a germline heterozygous truncating pathogenic variant in CTNNA1 identified by molecular genetic testing. Affected individuals from families that meet consensus genetic testing criteria for DGLBCS who do not have an identified pathogenic variant in CDH1 or CTNNA1 have suspected DGLBCS of unknown genetic cause (also referred to as hereditary diffuse gastric cancer [HDGC]- like).

GeneReviews regardless of family history or a DGLBCS-related CTNNA1 pathogenic variant and a family history of DGC and/or LBC. Supportive care: Management of DGLBCS requires a multidisciplinary team. Standard treatment to eradicate H pylori infection; total gastrectomy for early or advanced DGC; perioperative and/or adjuvant therapy for advanced DGC; surgery, hormonal therapy, and perioperative and/or adjuvant chemotherapy for LBC; consider risk-reducing contralateral mastectomy; standard treatments for cleft correction by craniofacial specialists. Surveillance: For individuals with CDH1- or CTNNA1-related DGLBCS, referral to a high-risk gastric screening program with a thorough 30-minute upper endoscopy with multiple targeted and random biopsies every six to 12 months beginning in early adulthood or five to ten years prior to the earliest gastric cancer diagnosis in the family. For females with CDH1-related DGLBCS or CTNNA1-related DGLBCS and personal or family history of breast cancer, referral to a high-risk breast cancer screening program with monthly self-breast exams beginning at age 20 years; annual clinical breast examinations, education on clinical features of breast cancer, and bilateral breast MRI with contrast from age 30 years; annual mammography between MRI screens from age 30-40 years; if MRI is unavailable, breast ultrasound should be combined with mammogram. In individuals with CDH1-related cleft lip/palate, annual audiology and speech evaluation throughout childhood. In individuals with suspected DGLBCS of unknown cause (also referred to as HDGC-like), referral to a high- risk gastric screening program with a thorough 30-minute upper endoscopy with multiple targeted and random biopsies annually beginning at age 40 years or ten years prior to the earliest gastric cancer diagnosis in the family; endoscopy interval can be increased after two consecutive normal biopsies at the discretion of the endoscopist. Referral to a high-risk breast cancer screening program; in those with a personal or family history of breast cancer of any type, monthly self-exams beginning at age 20 years, annual clinical breast exam and education of clinical features of breast cancer beginning at age 30 years; additional breast screening as recommended by high-risk breast cancer specialists. Evaluation of relatives at risk: Offer at-risk relatives of a proband with CDH1- or CTNNA1-related DGLBCS predictive testing for the familial pathogenic variant. This will allow identification of individuals who would benefit from intensive surveillance for early cancer detection and/or prophylactic surgeries targeting organs associated with DGLBCS. Offer first-degree relatives of a proband with suspected DGLBCS of unknown genetic cause (HDGC-like) surveillance tailored to the individual's personal and family history. Pregnancy management: Nutritional consequences of total gastrectomy should be discussed before and during pregnancy. Pregnancy should be delayed at least six to 12 months after total gastrectomy, to allow for weight stabilization and nutritional recovery. Genetic counselling DGLBCS is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. The majority of individuals diagnosed with CDH1- related DGLBCS inherited the CDH1 pathogenic variant from a parent (because of reduced penetrance, the parent from whom the pathogenic variant was inherited may not have developed cancer). Some individuals diagnosed with CTNNA1-related DGLBCS have an affected first- or second-degree relative with gastric or breast cancer. Some individuals with DGLBCS have the disorder as the result of a de novo pathogenic variant. Each child of an individual with DGLBCS has a 50% chance of inheriting the DGLBCS-related pathogenic variant. If the DGLBCS-related pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, predictive testing for at-risk relatives and prenatal/preimplantation genetic testing are possible.

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) is characterized by clinical features that typically develop in childhood and resemble some features of accelerated aging. Children with HGPS usually appear normal at birth. Profound failure to thrive occurs during the first year. Characteristic facial features include head that is disproportionately large for the face, narrow nasal ridge, narrow nasal tip, thin vermilion of the upper and lower lips, small mouth, and retro- and micrognathia. Common features include loss of subcutaneous fat, delayed eruption and loss of primary teeth, abnormal skin with small outpouchings over the abdomen and upper thighs, alopecia, nail dystrophy, coxa valga, and progressive joint contractures. Later findings include low-frequency conductive hearing loss, dental crowding, and partial lack of secondary tooth eruption. Motor and mental development is normal. Death occurs as a result of complications of severe atherosclerosis, either cardiac disease (myocardial infarction or heart failure) or cerebrovascular disease (stroke), generally between ages six and 20 years (average 14.5 years) without lonafarnib treatment or cardiac surgery intervention. Average life span is extended to approximately 17-19.5 years with lonafarnib therapy. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of classic or nonclassic genotype HGPS is established in a proband with characteristic clinical features, along with identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in LMNA that results in production of the abnormal lamin A protein, progerin. Individuals with classic genotype HGPS are heterozygous for pathogenic variant c.1824C>T (~90% of individuals with HGPS). Individuals with nonclassic genotype HGPS have the characteristic clinical features of HGPS and are heterozygous for another LMNA pathogenic variant in exon 11 or intron 11 that results in production of progerin (~10% of individuals with HGPS).

Management GeneReviews Targeted therapy: Lonafarnib is an approved medication for HGPS; benefits include improved low-tone hearing, decreased headaches, decreased carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity, decreased arterial wall stiffness, and increased life span. Supportive care: A regular diet with frequent small meals is recommended. Primary tooth extractions after the secondary tooth has erupted and/or fully descended may be required to avoid dental crowding. Use of sunscreen on all exposed areas of skin, including the head, is recommended for outdoor activities. Hip dislocation is best managed with physical therapy and body bracing; reconstructive hip surgery is possible, but comorbidities of surgery in this high-risk population should be considered. Shoe pads are recommended, as lack of body fat leads to foot discomfort. Routine physical and occupational therapy, active stretching and strengthening exercises, and hydrotherapy are recommended. Maintain optimal hydration, while encouraging physical activity, to minimize stroke risk. Modified transcatheter aortic valve replacement or modified apico-aortic valve replacement are high- risk interventions to treat critical aortic stenosis, yielding improved cardiac status and quality of life and increased life span. Anticoagulation as needed for cardiovascular and neurovascular complications. Medication dosages are based on body weight or body surface area, not age. Nitroglycerin can be beneficial for angina; anticongestive therapy is routine for the treatment of congestive heart failure. General anesthesia and intubation should be performed with extreme caution, ideally with fiberoptic intubation, if possible. Exposure keratopathy can be treated with ocular lubrication. Hearing aids can be used when clinically necessary. Age-appropriate schooling with adaptations for physical needs is usually recommended. Prevention of secondary complications: Low-dose aspirin (2-3 mg/kg body weight) is recommended for prevention of cardiovascular and stroke complications. Because the stiffened peripheral vasculature may be less tolerant to dehydration, maintaining optimal hydration orally is recommended. Surveillance: Annual or semiannual electrocardiogram (EKG), annual echocardiogram, carotid duplex ultrasound examination, neurologic examination, MRI/MRA of the head and neck, lipid profile, dental examination, hip x-ray to evaluate for avascular necrosis and progressing coxa valga, dual x-ray absorptiometry and/or peripheral cutaneous computed tomography to measure bone density, physical therapy assessment for joint contractures, ophthalmology examination, audiometry, and assessment of activities of daily living. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Dehydration; large crowds with taller/larger peers because of the risk of injury, trampolines and bouncy houses due to risk of hip dislocation. Physical activity should be self-limited. Genetic counseling Almost all individuals with HGPS have the disorder as the result of a de novo autosomal dominant pathogenic variant. Recurrence risk to the sibs of a proband is small (as HGPS is typically caused by a de novo pathogenic variant) but greater than that of the general population because of the possibility of parental germline mosaicism. Once the LMNA pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk is possible."

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Hyperornithinemia-hyperammonemia-homocitrullinuria (HHH) syndrome is a disorder of the urea cycle and ornithine degradation pathway. Clinical manifestations and age of onset vary among individuals even in the same family. Neonatal onset (~8% of affected individuals). Manifestations of hyperammonemia usually begin 24-48 hours after feeding begins and can include lethargy, somnolence, refusal to feed, vomiting, tachypnea with respiratory alkalosis, and/or seizures. Infantile, childhood, and adult onset (~92%). Affected individuals may present with: Chronic neurocognitive deficits (including developmental delay, ataxia, spasticity, learning disabilities, cognitive deficits, and/or unexplained seizures); Acute encephalopathy secondary to hyperammonemic crisis precipitated by a variety of factors; and Chronic liver dysfunction (unexplained elevation of liver transaminases with or without mild coagulopathy, with or without mild hyperammonemia and protein intolerance). Neurologic findings and cognitive abilities can continue to deteriorate despite early metabolic control that prevents hyperammonemia. Diagnosis/testing The biochemical diagnosis of HHH syndrome is established in a proband with the classic metabolic triad of episodic or postprandial hyperammonemia, persistent hyperornithinemia, and urinary excretion of homocitrulline. The molecular diagnosis of HHH syndrome is established in a symptomatic individual with or without suggestive metabolic/biochemical findings by identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in SLC25A15.

GeneReviews is a registered trademark of the University of Washington, Seattle. All rights reserved. Management GeneReviews Treatment of manifestations: Acute and long-term management is best performed in conjunction with a metabolic specialist. Of primary importance is the use of established protocols to rapidly control hyperammonemic episodes by discontinuation of protein intake, intravenous infusion of glucose and, as needed, infusion of supplemental arginine and the ammonia removal drugs sodium benzoate and sodium phenylacetate. Hemodialysis is performed if hyperammonemia persists and/or the neurologic status deteriorates. Prevention of primary manifestations: Individuals with HHH syndrome should be maintained on an age- appropriate protein-restricted diet, citrulline supplementation, and sodium phenylbutyrate to maintain plasma concentrations of ammonia, glutamine, arginine, and essential amino acids within normal range. Note: Liver transplantation is not indicated when metabolic control can be achieved with this regimen as liver transplantation may correct the hyperammonemia but will not correct tissue-specific metabolic abnormalities that also contribute to the neuropathology. Surveillance: Routine assessment of height, weight, and head circumference from the time of diagnosis to adolescence. Routine assessment of plasma ammonia concentration, plasma and urine amino acid concentrations, urine organic acids, and urine orotic acid based on age and history of adherence and metabolic control. Routine developmental and educational assessment to assure optional interventions. Attention to subtle changes in mood, behavior, and eating and/or the onset of vomiting, which may suggest that plasma concentrations of glutamine and ammonia are increasing. Periodic neurologic evaluation to monitor for neurologic deterioration even when metabolic control is optimal. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Excess dietary protein intake; nonprescribed protein supplements such as those used during exercise regimens; prolonged fasting during an illness or weight loss; oral and intravenous steroids; and valproic acid, which exacerbates hyperammonemia in urea cycle disorders. Evaluation of relatives at risk: Once the pathogenic variants in a family are known, use molecular genetic testing to clarify the genetic status of at-risk relatives to allow early diagnosis and treatment, perhaps even before symptoms occur. Pregnancy management: In general, pregnant women should continue dietary protein restriction and supplementation with citrulline and ammonia-scavenging medications based on their clinical course before pregnancy. Due to increased protein and energy requirements in pregnancy and, oftentimes, difficulty with patient adherence, weekly to every two-week monitoring of plasma amino acids and ammonia is recommended, especially in the first and third trimester, and close monitoring immediately after delivery. Genetic counseling HHH syndrome is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. At conception, each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Once the SLC25A15 pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member, carrier testing for at-risk relatives, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk, and preimplantation genetic testing are possible. However, the identification of familial SLC25A15 pathogenic variants cannot predict clinical outcome because of significant intrafamilial phenotypic variability."

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is characterized by the presence of multiple arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) that lack intervening capillaries and result in direct connections between arteries and veins. The most common clinical manifestation is spontaneous and recurrent nosebleeds (epistaxis) beginning on average at age 12 years. Telangiectases (small AVMs) are characteristically found on the lips, tongue, buccal and gastrointestinal (GI) mucosa, face, and fingers. The appearance of telangiectases is generally later than epistaxis but may be during childhood. Large AVMs occur most often in the lungs, liver, or brain; complications from bleeding or shunting may be sudden and catastrophic. A minority of individuals with HHT have GI bleeding, which is rarely seen before age 50 years. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of HHT is established in a proband with three or more of the following clinical features: Epistaxis Mucocutaneous telangiectases in characteristic locations Visceral AVMs A first-degree relative diagnosed with HHT on the basis of the preceding criteria Identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in ACVRL1, ENG, or SMAD4 establishes the diagnosis if clinical features are inconclusive.

Agents/circumstances to avoid: Vigorous nose blowing; lifting heavy objects; straining during bowel movements; finger manipulation in the nose; anticoagulant and anti-inflammatory agents (including aspirin) in individuals with significant nose or GI bleeding; scuba diving unless TCE within the last five years was negative for evidence of a right-to-left shunt; liver biopsy. Evaluation of relatives at risk: Molecular genetic testing is offered to at-risk family members if the germline pathogenic variant has been identified in the family. If the pathogenic variant in the family is not known, at-risk family members should be evaluated for signs and symptoms of HHT, and screening should be offered to at-risk family members if the diagnosis cannot be ruled out. Pregnancy management: Women with HHT considering pregnancy are screened and treated for pulmonary and cerebral AVMs; sizable pulmonary AVMs discovered during pregnancy are treated during the second trimester. Iron replacement is preferred for anemia, but transfusion of packed red blood cells may be necessary for symptomatic anemia despite aggressive iron replacement therapy. Genetic counseling HHT is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner with considerable intrafamilial variability. Most individuals have an affected parent. Each child of a proband and the sibs of most probands are at a 50% risk of inheriting the pathogenic variant. Prenatal testing is possible for a pregnancy at increased risk if the pathogenic variant in the family is known."

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics STAT3 hyper IgE syndrome (STAT3-HIES) is a primary immune deficiency syndrome characterized by elevated serum IgE, eczema, and recurrent skin and respiratory tract infections, together with several nonimmune features. This disorder typically manifests in the newborn period with a rash (often diagnosed as eosinophilic pustulosis) that subsequently evolves into an eczematoid dermatitis. Recurrent staphylococcal skin boils and bacterial pneumonias usually manifest in the first years of life. Pneumatoceles and bronchiectasis often result from aberrant healing of pneumonias. Mucocutaneous candidiasis is common. Nonimmune features may include retained primary teeth, scoliosis, bone fractures following minimal trauma, joint hyperextensibility, and characteristic facial appearance, which typically emerges in adolescence. Vascular abnormalities have been described and include middle-sized artery tortuosity and aneurysms, with infrequent clinical sequelae of myocardial infarction and subarachnoid hemorrhage. Gastrointestinal (GI) manifestations include gastroesophageal reflux disease, esophageal dysmotility, and spontaneous intestinal perforations (some of which are associated with diverticuli). Fungal infections of the GI tract (typically histoplasmosis, Cryptococcus, and Coccidioides) also occur infrequently. Survival is typically into adulthood, with most individuals now living into or past the sixth decade. Most deaths are associated with gram-negative (Pseudomonas) or filamentous fungal pneumonias resulting in hemoptysis. Lymphomas occur at an increased frequency. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of STAT3-HIES is established in a proband with typical clinical findings and a heterozygous dominant-negative pathogenic variant in STAT3 identified by molecular genetic testing.

Management GeneReviews Treatment of manifestations: The mainstay of treatment is prevention of staphylococcal abscesses and pneumonias with anti-staphylococcal prophylactic antibiotics as well as early aggressive treatment of infections. Use of antibiotics and antifungal agents depends on the nature of the infection and the extent of involvement. Antiseptic therapies for the skin such as dilute bleach baths and chlorhexidine are beneficial. Medications such as histamine-1 antagonists to control pruritus are helpful for more significant eczema. There is no known treatment or prevention for the nonimmunologic characteristics, although optimization of calcium and vitamin D intake may be considered to improve bone health. The role of hematopoietic cell transplantation (HSCT) in STAT3-HIES is emerging; while successful transplant recipients have improved infection phenotype, the effect of HSCT on the nonimmunologic aspects of the disease remains unclear. Surveillance: Periodic chest imaging and high clinical suspicion assist in early detection of lung infections. Culture of skin lesions and sputum samples helps direct therapy. Routine screening of adolescents for early signs of scoliosis is recommended. Dental monitoring is necessary to ensure timely removal of primary teeth to allow eruption of secondary teeth. Evaluation for coronary artery and cerebral aneurysms every three years in adulthood is recommended as well as monitoring for lymphadenopathy in case of increased incidence of lymphoma. Genetic counseling STAT3-HIES is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. The majority of affected individuals have the disorder as the result of a de novo pathogenic variant. Each child of an individual with STAT3-HIES has a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant. Prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible once the STAT3 pathogenic variant in the family has been identified."

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (fHLH), defined as the presence of biallelic pathogenic variants in one of four genes (PRF1, STX11, STXBP2, or UNC13D), is an immune deficiency characterized by the overactivation and excessive proliferation of T lymphocytes and macrophages, leading to infiltration and damage of organs including the bone marrow, liver, spleen, and brain. Familial HLH usually presents as an acute illness with prolonged and high fever, cytopenias, and hepatosplenomegaly. Rash and lymphadenopathy are less common. Individuals with fHLH may also exhibit liver dysfunction and neurologic abnormalities. Although manifestations of fHLH are usually evident within the first months or years of life and may develop in utero, symptomatic presentation can occur throughout childhood and into adulthood. Median survival in untreated infants with fHLH who develop active disease is less than two months after onset of manifestations; progressive manifestations of fHLH, organ dysfunction, invasive infection, and bleeding account for the majority of deaths. However, the use of newer chemoimmunotherapy protocols followed by allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has improved survival.

Copyright 1993-2024, University of Washington, Seattle. GeneReviews is a registered trademark of the University of Washington, Seattle. All rights reserved. Diagnosis/testing GeneReviews The diagnosis of fHLH is established in a proband with suggestive findings by identification of either biallelic pathogenic variants in one of four genes (PRF1, STX11, STXBP2, or UNC13D) or (rarely) a gain-of-function heterozygous variant in STXBP2. Management Targeted therapies: Treatment regimens focus on use of chemoimmunotherapy to treat active disease followed by allogeneic HSCT, the only curative therapy. Etoposide-containing regimens such as HLH-94 and HLH-2004, followed by allogeneic HSCT, are typically used. A regimen that includes anti-interferon-gamma antibody (emapalumab) is FDA approved for the treatment of children and adults with relapsed or refractory HLH or intolerance of conventional therapies. Supportive care: Management should be coordinated by or in consultation with a multidisciplinary team with expertise in fHLH, including specialists in hematology/oncology, bone marrow and stem cell transplantation, immunology, rheumatology, infectious diseases, critical care, neurology, nephrology, pathology, and medical genetics. Supportive care that should accompany treatment with chemoimmunotherapy and allogenic HSCT includes antibiotics or antiviral agents to treat or prevent infections, and antipyretics, intravenous fluids, electrolyte replacement, transfusion of packed red blood cells and platelets, infusions of immunoglobulin, fresh frozen plasma, and/or cryoprecipitate. Surveillance: Individuals responding to treatment and HSCT are technically not at risk for other organ system involvement; thus, surveillance focuses on potential complications of fHLH while fHLH is active, such as bleeding, hypotension, respiratory distress, neurologic complications, malnutrition, infection, liver, or other organ failure. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Live vaccines; exposure to infections; acetaminophen in persons with liver failure; nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in persons with thrombocytopenia; areas of construction or soil manipulation (which increase the risk for fungal infection in individuals with neutropenia); transfusion of non- irradiated blood products in individuals undergoing chemoimmunotherapy and/or allogeneic HSCT. Evaluation of relatives at risk: It is appropriate to identify before symptoms occur those at-risk sibs who have the family-specific pathogenic variants so that they can be monitored and preemptive HSCT considered (particularly during febrile episodes) for development of manifestations of active disease. Any manifestations of possible active disease should prompt more detailed evaluation and referral to a clinician with expertise in fHLH. Genetic counseling Familial HLH is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. (Autosomal dominant inheritance of STXBP2- fHLH is suggested by rare reports of symptomatic individuals with heterozygous gain-of-function variants. Autosomal dominant inheritance will not be discussed further in this section.) If both parents are known to be heterozygous for an fHLH-causing pathogenic variant, each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of inheriting biallelic pathogenic variants, a 50% chance of inheriting one pathogenic variant and being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of inheriting neither of the familial fHLH-causing pathogenic variants. Once the fHLH-causing pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member, carrier testing for at-risk relatives and prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics FH tumor predisposition syndrome is characterized by cutaneous leiomyomata, uterine leiomyomata (fibroids), and/or renal tumors. Pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma have also been described in a small number of families. Cutaneous leiomyomata appear as skin-colored to light brown papules or nodules distributed over the trunk and extremities, and occasionally on the face, and appear at a mean age of 30 years, increasing in size and number with age. Uterine leiomyomata tend to be numerous and large; age at diagnosis ranges from 18 to 53 years, with most women experiencing irregular or heavy menstruation and pelvic pain. Renal tumors are usually unilateral, solitary, and aggressive. They are associated with poor survival due to clinical aggressiveness and propensity to metastasize despite small primary tumor size. The median age of detection is approximately age 40 years. Diagnosis/testing Diagnosis of FH tumor predisposition syndrome is established by identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in FH. Management Treatment of manifestations: Surgical excision, carbon dioxide laser, cryotherapy, or electrodessication to remove painful cutaneous leiomyomas. Medications are used as an adjunct for pain relief, and may include drugs that lead to vasodilation (e.g., nitroglycerin, nifedipine, phenoxybenzamine, doxazosin) and/or drugs for neuropathic pain (e.g., gabapentin, pregabalin, duloxetine). Treatment of uterine fibroids can include gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists, antihormonal medications, intrauterine devices releasing progesterone, myomectomy, and hysterectomy. Consultation with a urologic oncology surgeon familiar with this syndrome should be sought for kidney tumors. Total or partial nephrectomy with wide margins may be carefully considered in some settings.

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Hereditary myopathy with early respiratory failure (HMERF) is a slowly progressive myopathy that typically begins in the third to fifth decades of life. The usual presenting findings are gait disturbance relating to distal leg weakness or nocturnal respiratory symptoms due to respiratory muscle weakness. Weakness eventually generalizes and affects both proximal and distal muscles. Most affected individuals require walking aids within a few years of onset; some progress to wheelchair dependence and require nocturnal noninvasive ventilatory support about ten years after onset. The phenotype varies even among individuals within the same family: some remain ambulant until their 70s whereas others may require ventilator support in their 40s. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of HMERF is established in a proband with typical clinical findings and/or a heterozygous pathogenic variant in the region of TTN that encodes the 119th fibronectin-3 domain of titin on molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Management is supportive. For distal leg weakness, use of ankle-foot orthoses can optimize independent ambulation early in the disease course; later in the disease course other mobility aids (canes, walkers, or wheelchairs) may be required. Noninvasive ventilation with bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) or continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) may be indicated for nocturnal hypoventilation initially, followed by mechanical ventilatory support as needed.

Pregnancy management: Although the onset of symptoms usually occurs after the age of childbearing, a pregnant woman with early manifestations of HMERF or at risk for HMERF should be considered high-risk because of the associated respiratory muscle weakness and the increased physiologic demands of pregnancy. Consultation with a high-risk maternal-fetal medicine specialist is recommended when possible. Genetic counseling HMERF is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner with variable expressivity. Most individuals diagnosed with HMERF have an affected parent; to date, de novo pathogenic variants have not been reported in any individuals with genetically confirmed HMERF.

Clinical characteristics Hereditary neuralgic amyotrophy (HNA) is characterized by sudden onset of severe, non-abating pain in the shoulder girdle and/or the upper limb and amyotrophy (muscle wasting or atrophy) that typically develops within two weeks of the onset of severe pain. Other sites may also be involved in an attack; sensory symptoms, present in the majority of affected individuals, can include hypoesthesia (decreased sensation) and paresthesias. Onset is typically in the second or third decade (median age 28 years). Although attacks appear to become less frequent with age, residual deficits accumulate with subsequent attacks. In some families, non-neurologic findings (characteristic craniofacial features, bifid uvula or cleft palate, short stature, and/or partial syndactyly of the fingers or toes) are present.

Cancer risks and age of onset vary depending on the associated gene. Several other cancer types have been reported to occur in individuals with Lynch syndrome (e.g., breast, sarcomas, adrenocortical carcinoma). However, the data are not sufficient to demonstrate that the risk of developing these cancers is increased in individuals with Lynch syndrome.

Annual education for females regarding the symptoms of endometrial and ovarian cancers. Consider transvaginal ultrasound examination and endometrial biopsy every one to two years. Consider upper endoscopy examination every three to five years beginning between ages 30 and 35 years particularly for individuals with a family history of gastric cancer and those of Asian ancestry. Biopsies should be evaluated for H pylori infections so that appropriate treatment can be given as needed. Consider capsule endoscopy and small bowel enterography for distal small bowel cancers. Consider urine analysis with urine cytology to identify microscopic hematuria in those with a family history of urothelial cancer. Consider pancreatic cancer screening in individuals with a family history of pancreatic cancer with alternating endoscopic ultrasound and/or MRI/magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography. Agents/circumstances to avoid: High body mass, cigarette smoking, type 2 diabetes, and high cholesterol. Evaluation of relatives at risk: When a diagnosis of Lynch syndrome has been confirmed in a proband, molecular genetic testing for the Lynch syndrome-related pathogenic variant should be offered to first-degree relatives to identify those who would benefit from early surveillance and intervention. Although molecular genetic testing for Lynch syndrome is generally not recommended for at-risk individuals younger than age 18 years, a history of early cancers in the family may warrant predictive testing prior to age 18. Genetic counseling Lynch syndrome caused by a heterozygous germline pathogenic variant in MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2 or by an EPCAM deletion is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Individuals with Lynch syndrome caused by constitutional inactivation of MLH1 by methylation typically represent simplex cases but families with non- mendelian inheritance of hypermethylation have been reported. The majority of individuals with Lynch syndrome inherited a pathogenic variant from a parent; however, because of incomplete penetrance, variable age of cancer development, cancer risk reduction as a result of screening or prophylactic surgery, or early death, not all individuals with a pathogenic variant in one of the genes associated with Lynch syndrome have a parent who had cancer. Each child of an individual with Lynch syndrome has a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant.

The most common initial manifestation is the acute onset of a non-painful focal sensory and motor neuropathy in a single nerve (mononeuropathy). The first attack usually occurs in the second or third decade but earlier onset is possible. Neuropathic pain is increasingly recognized as a common manifestation. Recovery from acute neuropathy is usually complete; when recovery is not complete, the resulting disability is mild. Some affected individuals also demonstrate a mild-to-moderate peripheral neuropathy. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of HNPP is established in a proband with suggestive clinical and electrophysiologic findings and either the 1.5-Mb recurrent deletion or a novel deletion involving PMP22 (in 80%), or a PMP22 sequence variant (in 20%) identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Treatment is symptomatic and involves occupational therapy and physical therapy as needed to address issues with fine motor and gross motor skills, including activities of daily living. Bracing, such as with a wrist splint or ankle-foot orthosis, may be useful transiently or in some instances permanently. Special shoes, including those with good ankle support, may be needed. Neuropathic pain can be treated with analgesic medications. Protective pads at elbows or knees may prevent pressure and trauma to local nerves.

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Homocystinuria caused by cystathionine -synthase (CBS) deficiency is characterized by involvement of the eye (ectopia lentis and/or severe myopia), skeletal system (excessive height, long limbs, scolioisis, and pectus excavatum), vascular system (thromboembolism), and CNS (developmental delay/intellectual disability). All four or only one of the systems can be involved; expressivity is variable for all of the clinical signs. It is not unusual for a previously asymptomatic individual to present in adult years with only a thromboembolic event that is often cerebrovascular. Two phenotypic variants are recognized, B6-responsive homocystinuria and B6- non-responsive homocystinuria. B6-responsive homocystinuria is usually milder than the non-responsive variant. Thromboembolism is the major cause of early death and morbidity. IQ in individuals with untreated homocystinuria ranges widely, from 10 to 138. In B6-responsive individuals the mean IQ is 79 versus 57 for those who are B6-non-responsive. Other features that may occur include: seizures, psychiatric problems, extrapyramidal signs (e.g., dystonia), hypopigmentation of the skin and hair, malar flush, livedo reticularis, and pancreatitis. Diagnosis/testing The cardinal biochemical features of homocystinuria include markedly increased concentrations of plasma total homocysteine and methionine. The diagnosis can be substantiated by detection of biallelic pathogenic variants in CBS, the gene encoding cystathionine -synthase.

Management GeneReviews Treatment of manifestations: Treatment aims to correct the biochemical abnormalities, especially to control the plasma homocysteine concentrations and prevent thrombosis. Complications of homocystinuria should be managed appropriately; e.g., by surgery for ectopia lentis. Prevention of primary manifestations: Individuals are treated to maintain normal or near-normal plasma total homocysteine concentrations using vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) therapy (if shown to be B6 responsive), a methionine-restricted diet, and folate and vitamin B12 supplementation. Betaine therapy is usually added to the therapeutic regimen; in adolescents and adults, betaine may be the major form of treatment, but it is preferable to remain on life-long metabolic diet. Surveillance: Affected individuals should be monitored at regular intervals to detect any clinical complications that may develop, for dietary compliance and for measurement of plasma total homocysteine and amino acids. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Oral contraceptives in affected females. Surgery if possible. If surgery is required, intravenous fluid with 5% dextrose in 0.5 normal saline at 1.5 times maintenance should be given and continued until oral fluids are taken ad lib, with close monitoring to avoid fluid overload. Evaluation of relatives at risk: Measurement of total homocysteine and amino acids in at-risk sibs immediately after birth ensures reduction of morbidity and mortality by early diagnosis and treatment. If the CBS pathogenic variants in the family are known, molecular genetic testing can be used to clarify the genetic status of sibs Pregnancy management: For women with classic homocystinuria: dietary treatment and betaine, and vitamin B6 for those B6 responsive, with careful biochemical monitoring throughout pregnancy. Prophylactic anticoagulation with low molecular-weight heparin is recommended during the third trimester and post partum to reduce risk of thromboembolism. Genetic counseling Homocystinuria is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. At conception, each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Carrier testing for at-risk family members and prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk are possible if the CBS pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member."

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Hypophosphatasia is characterized by defective mineralization of growing or remodeling bone, with or without root-intact tooth loss, in the presence of low activity of serum and bone alkaline phosphatase. Clinical features range from stillbirth without mineralized bone at the severe end to pathologic fractures of the lower extremities in later adulthood at the mild end. While the disease spectrum is a continuum, seven clinical forms of hypophosphatasia are usually recognized based on age at diagnosis and severity of features: Perinatal (severe): Characterized by pulmonary insufficiency and hypercalcemia Perinatal (benign): Prenatal skeletal manifestations that slowly resolve into one of the milder forms Infantile: Onset between birth and age six months of clinical features of rickets without elevated serum alkaline phosphatase activity Severe childhood (juvenile): Variable presenting features progressing to rickets Mild childhood: Low bone mineral density for age, increased risk of fracture, and premature loss of primary teeth with intact roots Adult: Characterized by stress fractures and pseudofractures of the lower extremities in middle age, sometimes associated with early loss of adult dentition Odontohypophosphatasia: Characterized by premature exfoliation of primary teeth and/or severe dental caries without skeletal manifestations Diagnosis/testing The clinical diagnosis of hypophosphatasia can be established in a proband with suggestive clinical, laboratory, and radiographic features by identification of reduced serum unfractionated alkaline phosphatase activity Author Affiliation: 1 Director of Medical Genetics and Metabolism, Valley Children's Hospital, Madera, California; Email: mnunes3@valleychildrens.org.

GeneReviews and/or identification on molecular genetic testing of biallelic loss-of-function ALPL variants or a heterozygous ALPL variant with dominant-negative effect. Management Targeted therapy: Asfotase alfa (Strensiq) enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) has been shown to improve pulmonary function, calcium homeostasis / bone health, and survival in individuals with the infantile and early childhood (juvenile) type of hypophosphatasia. There is growing experience with ERT in individuals with the perinatal (severe) type and emerging experience with ERT in treating osteomalacia in adults. Supportive care: For the perinatal (severe) type: expectant management and family support; respiratory support; management of calcium homeostasis and bone health per endocrinologist and orthopedist; pain management; neurosurgical management of craniosynostosis; management of kidney disease per nephrologist; dental care. For the infantile and early childhood (juvenile) types: respiratory support; management of calcium homeostasis and bone health per endocrinologist and orthopedist; pain management; treatment of seizures with vitamin B6; neurosurgical management of craniosynostosis; management of kidney disease per nephrologist; dental care. For all other types: dental care starting at age one year; nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for osteoarthritis, bone pain, and osteomalacia; internal fixation for pseudofractures and stress fractures. In adult hypophosphatasia, there is limited experience in treating osteomalacia with teriparatide. Surveillance: Monitor calcium homeostasis and bone health per endocrinologist, nephrologist, and orthopedist; physical medicine and rehabilitation, physical therapy, and occupational therapy evaluations as needed; monitor children with infantile type for increased intracranial pressure secondary to craniosynostosis; nephrology evaluations as needed for kidney disease; neurology evaluations as needed for seizures; dental visits twice yearly starting at age one year. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Bisphosphonates and excess vitamin D; teriparatide is contraindicated in children. Pregnancy management: The use of asfotase alfa (Strensiq) ERT during human pregnancy has not been extensively studied; therefore, any potential risk to the fetus of a pregnant woman taking this therapy during pregnancy is unknown. Genetic counseling Perinatal and infantile hypophosphatasia are typically inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. The milder forms, especially adult and odontohypophosphatasia, may be inherited in an autosomal recessive or autosomal dominant manner depending on the effect that the ALPL pathogenic variant has on TNSALP (alkaline phosphatase, tissue-nonspecific isozyme) activity. Autosomal recessive hypophosphatasia: If both parents are known to be heterozygous for an ALPL pathogenic variant, each sib of an affected individual has at conception a 25% chance of inheriting biallelic pathogenic variants and being affected, a 50% chance of being heterozygous, and a 25% chance of inheriting neither of the familial pathogenic variants. Depending on the ALPL pathogenic variant, heterozygous sibs may be either clinically asymptomatic (manifesting only biochemical abnormality) or have milder clinical symptoms than the proband. Autosomal dominant hypophosphatasia: All individuals reported to date with hypophosphatasia caused by a heterozygous ALPL variant with a dominant-negative effect inherited the ALPL pathogenic variant from a parent (who may or may not have clinical manifestations of hypophosphatasia). Unless an individual with autosomal dominant hypophosphatasia has children with an individual who has a heterozygous or biallelic ALPL pathogenic variant(s), offspring have a 50% chance of inheriting the ALPL pathogenic variant. 3 Once the ALPL pathogenic variant(s) have been identified in an affected family member, heterozygote testing for at-risk relatives, prenatal testing, and preimplantation genetic testing for hypophosphatasia are possible. Recurrence of perinatal and infantile hypophosphatasia may reliably be identified by prenatal ultrasound examination."

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Holt-Oram syndrome (HOS) is characterized by upper-limb defects, congenital heart malformation, and cardiac conduction disease. Upper-limb malformations may be unilateral, bilateral/symmetric, or bilateral/asymmetric and can range from triphalangeal or absent thumb(s) to phocomelia. Other upper-limb malformations can include unequal arm length caused by aplasia or hypoplasia of the radius, fusion or anomalous development of the carpal and thenar bones, abnormal forearm pronation and supination, abnormal opposition of the thumb, sloping shoulders, and restriction of shoulder joint movement. An abnormal carpal bone is present in all affected individuals and may be the only evidence of disease. A congenital heart malformation is present in 75% of individuals with HOS and most commonly involves the septum. Atrial septal defect and ventricular septal defect can vary in number, size, and location. Complex congenital heart malformations can also occur in individuals with HOS. Individuals with HOS with or without a congenital heart malformation are at risk for cardiac conduction disease. While individuals may present at birth with sinus bradycardia and first-degree atrioventricular (AV) block, AV block can progress unpredictably to a higher grade including complete heart block with and without atrial fibrillation. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of HOS is established in a proband with a preaxial radial ray anomaly and a personal or family history of cardiac septation and/or conduction defects. More than 70% of individuals who meet strict clinical diagnostic criteria have an identifiable heterozygous pathogenic variant in TBX5.

Management GeneReviews Treatment of manifestations: Management involves a multidisciplinary team of specialists in medical genetics, cardiology, orthopedics, and hand surgery. Treatment for arrhythmias may require medication, surgery, and/or pacemaker implantation. Pharmacologic treatment for individuals with pulmonary hypertension. Cardiac surgery for congenital heart defects is standard; affected individuals and families are also likely to benefit from programs providing social support to those with limb anomalies. Prevention of secondary complications: A cardiologist can assist in determining the need for anticoagulants and antibiotic prophylaxis for bacterial endocarditis. Surveillance: Annual EKG for all affected individuals, annual Holter monitor for individuals with known conduction disease, and echocardiogram every one to five years for those with septal defects or as directed by a cardiologist. Evaluation of relatives at risk: Presymptomatic diagnosis and treatment is warranted in relatives at risk to identify those who would benefit from appropriate cardiac management. Pregnancy management: Affected women who have not undergone cardiac evaluation should do so prior to pregnancy or as soon as the pregnancy is recognized; those with a known history of a structural cardiac defect or cardiac conduction abnormality should be followed by a cardiologist during pregnancy. Genetic counseling HOS is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Approximately 85% of affected individuals have HOS as the result of a de novo pathogenic variant. Offspring of an affected individual are at a 50% risk of being affected. In pregnancies at 50% risk, detailed high-resolution prenatal ultrasound examination may detect upper-limb malformations and/or congenital heart malformations. Prenatal molecular genetic testing may be used to confirm a diagnosis if the TBX5 pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected relative."

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Hypokalemic periodic paralysis (hypoPP) is a condition in which affected individuals may experience paralytic episodes with concomitant hypokalemia (serum potassium <3.5 mmol/L). The paralytic attacks are characterized by decreased muscle tone (flaccidity) more marked proximally than distally with normal to decreased deep tendon reflexes. The episodes develop over minutes to hours and last several minutes to several days with spontaneous recovery. Some individuals have only one episode in a lifetime; more commonly, crises occur repeatedly: daily, weekly, monthly, or less often. The major triggering factors are cessation of effort following strenuous exercise and carbohydrate-rich evening meals. Additional triggers can include cold, stress/excitement/fear, salt intake, prolonged immobility, use of glucosteroids or alcohol, and anesthetic procedures. The age of onset of the first attack ranges from two to 30 years; the duration of paralytic episodes ranges from one to 72 hours with an average of nearly 24 hours. Long-lasting interictal muscle weakness may occur in some affected individuals and in some stages of the disease and in myopathic muscle changes. A myopathy may occur independent of paralytic symptoms and may be the sole manifestation of hypoPP. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of hypoPP is established in a proband who meets the consensus diagnostic criteria based on a history of attacks of muscle weakness associated with documented serum potassium <3.5 mmol/L during attacks and/or the identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in CACNA1S or SCN4A. Of all individuals meeting diagnostic criteria for hypoPP, approximately 30% do not have a pathogenic variant identified in either of these known genes. In the case of long-lasting interictal flaccid muscle weakness, imaging techniques can inform on the pathogenesis, potential therapy, and prognosis.

GeneReviews techniques with high accuracy for the disease. The weakness can be caused by edemas, fatty muscle degeneration, and muscle atrophy or a combination of these pathologies. Management Treatment of manifestations. Treatment varies depending on the intensity and duration of the paralytic attack. Minor attacks may resolve spontaneously. Moderate attacks may be self-treated in a non-medical setting by ingestion of oral potassium salts. Severe attacks typically require more intensive medical management with intravenous potassium infusion, serial measurement of serum potassium concentration, clinical evaluation of possible respiratory involvement, and continuous electrocardiogram monitoring. There is no known curative treatment for hypoPP-related myopathy; physiotherapy may help to maintain strength and motor skills. Prevention of primary manifestations. The goal of preventive treatment is to reduce the frequency and intensity of paralytic attacks. This may be achieved by avoidance of triggering factors, adherence to a diet low in sodium and carbohydrate and rich in potassium, and with the use of oral potassium supplementation. If dietary intervention and oral potassium supplementation are not effective in preventing attacks, treatment with a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor (acetazolamide or dichlorphenamide) may be necessary. If carbonic anhydrase inhibitors are not tolerated or not effective after prolonged use, alternatives include potassium-sparing diuretics such as triamterene, spironolactone, or eplerenone. Prevention of secondary complications. Creating a safe environment, getting help in case of paralytic attack, and preventing falls and accidents are critical; an affected person experiencing a paralytic attack must have access to potassium as well as physical assistance and companions must be informed of the risk in order to enable rapid treatment. Anesthetic complications should be prevented by strict control of serum potassium concentration, avoidance of large glucose and salt load, maintenance of body temperature and acid-base balance, and careful use of neuromuscular blocking agents with continuous monitoring of neuromuscular function. It is unknown whether prevention of paralytic attacks also prevents the development of myopathy. Individuals with known pathogenic variants in one of the genes associated with hypoPP who developed myopathy without having experienced episodes of weakness have been reported. Surveillance. The frequency of consultations is adapted to the individual's signs/symptoms and response to preventive treatment. Periodic neurologic examination with attention to muscle strength in the legs should be performed to detect long-lasting weakness associated with myopathy. For those taking acetazolamide, the following are indicated every three months: complete blood count; electrolytes; and glucose, uric acid, and liver enzyme levels. Renal ultrasound should be performed annually. Agents/circumstances to avoid. Factors that trigger paralytic attacks (e.g., unusually strenuous effort, carbohydrate-rich meals or sweets, cold, stress/excitement/fear, high salt intake, prolonged immobility, oral or intravenous glucosteroids, certain anesthetic procedures, alcohol) should be avoided when possible. Evaluation of relatives at risk. When the family-specific pathogenic variant is known, molecular genetic testing of at-risk asymptomatic family members can identify those at risk for unexpected acute paralysis and/or possible anesthetic complications. Genetic counseling HypoPP is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Most individuals diagnosed with hypoPP have an affected parent. The proportion of cases caused by a de novo pathogenic variant is unknown. Offspring of a proband are at a 50% risk of inheriting the pathogenic variant. Penetrance is about 90% in males and reduced in females. Once the pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS) is characterized by oculocutaneous albinism, a bleeding diathesis, and, in some individuals, pulmonary fibrosis, granulomatous colitis, and/or immunodeficiency. Ocular findings include nystagmus, reduced iris pigment, reduced retinal pigment, foveal hypoplasia with significant reduction in visual acuity (usually in the range of 20/50 to 20/400), and strabismus in many individuals. Hair color ranges from white to brown; skin color ranges from white to olive and is usually at least a shade lighter than that of other family members. The bleeding diathesis can result in variable degrees of bruising, epistaxis, gingival bleeding, postpartum hemorrhage, colonic bleeding, and prolonged bleeding with menses or after tooth extraction, circumcision, and/or other surgeries. Pulmonary fibrosis, colitis, and/or neutropenia have been reported in individuals with pathogenic variants in some HPS-related genes. Pulmonary fibrosis, a restrictive lung disease, typically causes symptoms in the early 30s and can progress to death within a decade. Granulomatous colitis is severe in about 15% of affected individuals. Neutropenia and/or immune defects occur primarily in individuals with pathogenic variants in AP3B1 and AP3D1. Diagnosis/testing The clinical diagnosis of HPS can be established in a proband with hypopigmentation of the skin and hair, characteristic eye findings, and demonstration of absence of platelet delta granules (dense bodies) on electron microscopy. Identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in AP3B1, AP3D1, BLOC1S3, BLOC1S5, BLOC1S6, DTNBP1, HPS1, HPS3, HPS4, HPS5, or HPS6 confirms the diagnosis if clinical features are inconclusive.

Immunodeficiency, when present, is lifelong and granulocyte colony- stimulating factor responsive, and affected individuals benefit from an infection prevention plan. Surveillance: Annual ophthalmologic examination including assessment for refractive errors; annual skin examination for evidence of sun-induced skin damage (e.g., solar keratoses [premalignant lesions], basal cell carcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma); annual pulmonary function testing in those older than age 20 years; colonoscopy in those with symptoms of colitis (e.g., cramping, mucoid stools, hematochezia, melena); assessment for clinical and laboratory manifestations of immunodeficiency. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Over-the-counter nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory products, aspirin-containing products, and other anticoagulants unless medically indicated; activities that increase the risk of bleeding; all tobacco and vaping products and inhalation of chemical and physical substances injurious to the lungs; unprotected and direct sun exposure. Evaluation of relatives at risk: In families with HPS3-, HPS5-, or HPS6-related HPS (milder types of HPS in which hypopigmentation and nystagmus may not be clinically evident), it is appropriate to clarify the status of apparently asymptomatic at-risk sibs in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from prompt initiation of treatment and preventive measures. Genetic counseling HPS is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. If both parents are known to be heterozygous for an HPS- causing pathogenic variant, each sib of an affected individual has at conception a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Once the HPS-causing pathogenic variants are identified in an affected family member, carrier testing for at-risk family members, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk, and preimplantation genetic testing are possible."

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics The spectrum of CDC73-related disorders includes the following phenotypes: Hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor (HPT-JT) syndrome. Primary hyperparathyroidism occurs in a vast majority of affected individuals, with onset typically in late adolescence or early adulthood. HPT-JT syndrome-associated primary hyperparathyroidism is usually caused by a single parathyroid adenoma. In at least 10%-15% of individuals, primary hyperparathyroidism is caused by parathyroid carcinoma. Ossifying fibromas of the mandible or maxilla, also known as cementifying fibromas and cemento- ossifying fibromas, occur in 30%-40% of individuals with HPT-JT syndrome. Although benign, these tumors can be locally aggressive and may continue to enlarge if not treated. Up to 20% of individuals with HPT-JT syndrome have kidney lesions, most commonly cysts; renal hamartomas and (more rarely) Wilms tumor have also been reported. Benign uterine tumors appear to be common in women with HPT-JT syndrome; uterine malignancies have also been reported. Parathyroid carcinoma. Most parathyroid carcinomas are functional, resulting in primary hyperparathyroidism and a high serum calcium level; however, nonfunctioning parathyroid carcinomas are also rarely described in individuals with a CDC73-related disorder. A germline CDC73 pathogenic variant has been identified in 20%-29% of individuals with parathyroid carcinoma without a known family history of CDC73-related conditions. Familial isolated hyperparathyroidism (FIHP). Characterized by primary hyperparathyroidism without other associated syndromic features. Individuals with CDC73-related FIHP tend to have a more severe clinical presentation and younger age of onset than individuals with FIHP in whom a CDC73 pathogenic variant has not been identified.

Diagnosis/testing GeneReviews The diagnosis is established in a proband with a germline heterozygous CDC73 pathogenic variant identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Parathyroidectomy is the preferred treatment for primary hyperparathyroidism, especially in individuals with HPT-JT syndrome. If parathyroid carcinoma is clinically suspected, an en bloc resection of the parathyroid gland with surrounding adherent tissue and the ipsilateral thyroid lobe should be considered. Intravenous fluids and a bisphosphonate infusion for severe or symptomatic hypercalcemia. Cinacalcet hydrochloride may be used for hypercalcemia in those with inoperable parathyroid adenoma or carcinoma. Calcium and vitamin D as needed for postoperative hypoparathyroidism. Jaw tumors should be treated surgically as indicated by size, location, and symptoms; the treatment of choice is complete resection, which may not be possible in all individuals. Treatment of kidney and uterine manifestations should be managed per nephrologist and gynecologist recommendations, respectively. Surveillance: Serum calcium, intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH), and 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels annually starting by age ten years. Periodic neck ultrasound as indicated based on serum calcium and iPTH levels. Dental examinations every six months; panoramic jaw x-ray with neck shielding at least every five years. Renal ultrasound at least every five years. Annual serum creatinine in those with kidney cysts. For women of reproductive age, annual gynecologic examination for uterine tumors with pelvic ultrasound every five years. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Dehydration; radiation exposure to the neck; biopsy of extrathyroidal tissue in the neck, which increases the risk of seeding of parathyroid tissue. Evaluation of relatives at risk: Molecular genetic testing for the CDC73 germline pathogenic variant identified in the proband should be offered to at-risk relatives by age ten years in order to identify those who would benefit from initiation of surveillance and treatment. Pregnancy management: Observation for mild asymptomatic hypercalcemia; minimally invasive resection of the parathyroid tumor (preferably in the second trimester) is required for symptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism or evidence of adverse effects on the fetus; management in conjunction with a maternal- fetal medicine specialist. Genetic counseling CDC73-related disorders are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. An individual with a CDC73-related disorder may have inherited a CDC73 pathogenic variant from an affected parent or have the disorder as the result of a de novo pathogenic variant. The proportion of individuals with a de novo pathogenic variant is unknown. Each child of an individual with a CDC73-related disorder has a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant. Once the CDC73 pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, predictive testing for at-risk relatives and prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing are possible."

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type II (HSAN2) is characterized by progressively reduced sensation to pain, temperature, and touch. Onset can be at birth and is often before puberty. The sensory deficit is predominantly distal with the lower limbs more severely affected than the upper limbs. Over time sensory function becomes severely reduced. Unnoticed injuries and neuropathic skin promote ulcerations and infections that result in spontaneous amputation of digits or the need for surgical amputation. Osteomyelitis is common. Painless fractures can complicate the disease. Autonomic disturbances are variable and can include hyperhidrosis, tonic pupils, and urinary incontinence in those with more advanced disease. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of HSAN2 is established in a proband with suggestive clinical and electrophysiologic findings and biallelic pathogenic variants in one of four genes: KIF1A, RETREG1 (FAM134B), SCN9A, or WNK1. Management Treatment of manifestations: Treatment is symptomatic and often involves a team including neurologists, orthopedic surgeons, and physiotherapists. Training in the care of the sensory-impaired limb, often in a diabetic foot care clinic, is important and includes self-examination especially of the feet for any signs of trauma. To prevent osteomyelitis, and hence the need for amputation, wounds require cleaning and protection along with antiseptic treatment. To prevent callous formation, the skin of neuropathic limbs requires hydration and lipid- based unguents. Appropriate shoes and socks are recommended. Surveillance: The feet should be inspected daily for injuries or sources of wear. Annual follow up in centers with comprehensive care of diabetics and/or persons with Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy is recommended.

The ability to sense all pain (including visceral pain) is absent, resulting in repeated injuries including: oral self-mutilation (biting of tongue, lips, and buccal mucosa); biting of fingertips; bruising, scarring, and infection of the skin; multiple bone fractures (many of which fail to heal properly); and recurrent joint dislocations resulting in joint deformity. Sense of touch, vibration, and position are normal. Anhidrosis predisposes to recurrent febrile episodes that are often the initial manifestation of NTRK1-CIPA. Hypothermia in cold environments also occurs. Intellectual disability of varying degree is observed in most affected individuals; hyperactivity and emotional lability are common. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of NTRK1-CIPA is established in a proband with suggestive clinical findings and biallelic pathogenic variants in NTRK1 identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Treatment is supportive and is best provided by specialists in pediatrics, orthopedics, dentistry, ophthalmology, and dermatology. For anhidrosis: Monitoring body temperature helps to institute timely measures to prevent/manage hyperthermia or hypothermia. For insensitivity to pain: Modify as much as reasonable a childs activities to prevent injuries. Inability to provide proper immobilization as a treatment for orthopedic injuries often delays healing; additionally, bracing and invasive orthopedic procedures increase the risk for infection.

Agents/circumstances to avoid: Hot or cold environments; hot or cold foods; hot showers or baths; jumping or high-impact activities and sports. Evaluation of relatives at risk: If the NTRK1 pathogenic variants in a family are known, molecular genetic testing can clarify the genetic status of at-risk infants, so that those who are affected can be monitored to avoid hyperpyrexia and its potential complications and oral injuries when the primary teeth erupt. Genetic counseling NTRK1-CIPA results from the presence of two NTRK1 pathogenic variants. Typically one pathogenic variant is inherited from each parent (autosomal recessive inheritance); however, in some instances both pathogenic variants are from one parent (uniparental isodisomy). Autosomal recessive (AR) inheritance. At conception, each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Uniparental isodisomy. The risk to sibs of an affected individual is not increased over that of the general population. For AR inheritance, once the NTRK1 pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member, carrier testing for at-risk family members, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk, and preimplantation genetic testing are possible. For uniparental isodisomy, once the NTRK1 pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, carrier testing for at-risk family members is possible."

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Mucopolysaccharidosis type II (MPS II; also known as Hunter syndrome) is an X-linked multisystem disorder characterized by glycosaminoglycan (GAG) accumulation. The vast majority of affected individuals are male; on rare occasion heterozygous females manifest findings. Age of onset, disease severity, and rate of progression vary significantly among affected males. In those with early progressive disease, CNS involvement (manifest primarily by progressive cognitive deterioration), progressive airway disease, and cardiac disease usually result in death in the first or second decade of life. In those with slowly progressive disease, the CNS is not (or is minimally) affected, although the effect of GAG accumulation on other organ systems may be early progressive to the same degree as in those who have progressive cognitive decline. Survival into the early adult years with normal intelligence is common in the slowly progressing form of the disease. Additional findings in both forms of MPS II include: short stature; macrocephaly with or without communicating hydrocephalus; macroglossia; hoarse voice; conductive and sensorineural hearing loss; hepatosplenomegaly; dysostosis multiplex; spinal stenosis; and carpal tunnel syndrome. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of MPS II is established in a male proband by identification of deficient iduronate 2-sulfatase (I2S) enzyme activity in white cells, fibroblasts, or plasma in the presence of normal activity of at least one other sulfatase. Detection of a hemizygous pathogenic variant in IDS confirms the diagnosis in a male proband with an unusual phenotype or a phenotype that does not match the results of GAG testing. The diagnosis of MPS II is usually established in a female proband with suggestive clinical features by identification of a heterozygous IDS pathogenic variant on molecular genetic testing.

Pre-treatment with anti-inflammatory drugs or antihistamines may be needed for mild or moderate infusion reactions. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) (using umbilical cord blood or bone marrow) could provide sufficient enzyme activity to slow or stop the progression of the disease; however, no controlled clinical studies have been conducted in MPS II. Supportive care: Interventions commonly include developmental, occupational, and physical therapy; shunting for hydrocephalus; tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy; positive pressure ventilation (CPAP or tracheostomy); carpal tunnel release; cardiac valve replacement; inguinal hernia repair; and hip replacement. Prevention of secondary complications: Anesthesia is best administered in centers familiar with the potential complications in persons with MPS II. Surveillance: Depends on organ system and disease severity and usually includes annual: cardiology evaluation and echocardiogram; pulmonary evaluation including pulmonary function testing; audiogram; ophthalmology examination; developmental assessment; neurologic examination. Additional studies may include: sleep study for obstructive apnea; nerve conduction velocity to assess for carpal tunnel syndrome; head/neck MRI to document ventricular size and cervicomedullary narrowing; opening pressure on lumbar puncture; and orthopedic evaluation to monitor hip disease. Evaluation of relatives at risk: While clinical experience suggests that early diagnosis of at-risk males allows initiation of ERT before the onset of irreversible changes and often before significant disease progression, it is unclear at present whether the potential benefits of early initiation of ERT justify early diagnosis by either newborn screening or testing of at-risk male relatives. Genetic counseling MPS II is inherited in an X-linked manner. The risk to sibs depends on the genetic status of the mother. If the mother of the proband has the pathogenic variant, the chance of transmitting it in each pregnancy is 50%. Males who inherit the pathogenic variant will be affected; females who inherit the pathogenic variant will be carriers. Germline mosaicism has been observed. Affected males pass the pathogenic variant to all of their daughters and none of their sons. Carrier testing for at-risk female relatives and prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk are possible if the pathogenic variant in the family is known."

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS) is characterized by hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and renal failure caused by platelet thrombi in the microcirculation of the kidney and other organs. The onset of atypical HUS (aHUS) ranges from the neonatal period to adulthood. Genetic aHUS accounts for an estimated 60% of all aHUS. Individuals with genetic aHUS frequently experience relapse even after complete recovery following the presenting episode; 60% of genetic aHUS progresses to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of genetic aHUS is established in a proband with aHUS by identification of a pathogenic variant(s) in one or more of the genes known to be associated with genetic aHUS. The genes associated with genetic aHUS include C3, CD46 (MCP), CFB, CFH, CFHR1, CFHR3, CFHR4, CFHR5, CFI, DGKE, THBD, and VTN. Management Treatment of manifestations: Eculizumab (a human anti-C5 monoclonal antibody) to treat aHUS and to induce remission of aHUS refractory to plasma therapy; plasma manipulation (plasma infusion or exchange) to reduce mortality; however, plasma resistance or plasma dependence is possible. Eculizumab therapy may not be beneficial to those with aHUS caused by pathogenic variants in DGKE. Treatment with ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor antagonists helps to control blood pressure and reduce renal disease progression. Bilateral nephrectomy when extensive renal microvascular thrombosis, refractory hypertension, and signs of hypertensive encephalopathy are not responsive to conventional therapies, including plasma manipulation. Renal transplantation may be an option, although recurrence of disease in the graft limits its usefulness.

GeneReviews Prevention of primary manifestations: Eculizumab prophylaxis may prevent disease recurrences in those with pathogenic variants in genes encoding circulating factors (CFH, C3, CFB, and CFI). Prevention of secondary complications: Eculizumab therapy may prevent thrombotic microangiopathic events and prophylactic treatment may prevent post-transplantation aHUS recurrence; vaccination against Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumonia, and Haemophilus influenza type B is required prior to eculizumab therapy; prophylactic antibiotics may be needed if vaccination against Neisseria meningitidis is not possible at least two weeks prior to eculizumab therapy. Surveillance: Serum concentration of hemoglobin, platelet count, and serum concentrations of creatinine, LDH, C3, C4, and haptoglobin: Every month in the first year after an aHUS episode, then every three to six months in the following years, particularly for those with normal renal function or chronic renal insufficiency as they are at risk for relapse; and In relatives with the pathogenic variant following exposure to potential triggering events. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Plasma therapy is contraindicated in those with aHUS induced by Streptococcus pneumoniae because antibodies in the plasma of adults may exacerbate the disease. Individuals with known aHUS should avoid pregnancy if possible and the following drugs that are known precipitants of aHUS: chemotherapeutic agents (e.g., mitomycin, cisplatin, daunorubicin, bleomycin, cytosine arabinoside, gemcitabine); immunotherapeutic agents (e.g., cyclosporin, tacrolimus, muromonab-CD3, interferon, quinidine); antiplatelet agents (e.g., ticlopidine, clopidogrel); oral contraceptives, and anti-inflammatory agents. Evaluation of relatives at risk: While it is appropriate to offer molecular genetic testing to at-risk relatives of persons in whom pathogenic variants have been identified, predictive testing based on a predisposing factor (as opposed to a pathogenic variant) is problematic as it is only one of several risk factors required for aHUS. Pregnancy management: Women with a history of aHUS are at increased risk for an aHUS flare during pregnancy and even a greater risk in the postpartum period; the risk for pregnancy-associated aHUS (P-aHUS) is highest during the second pregnancy. Women with complement dysregulation should be informed of the 20% risk for P-aHUS, and any pregnancy in these women should be closely monitored. Other: Live-related renal transplantation for individuals with aHUS should also be avoided in that disease onset can be precipitated in the healthy donor relative. Evidence suggests that kidney graft outcome is favorable in those with CD46 and DGKE pathogenic variants but not in those with C3, CFB, CFH, CFI, or THBD pathogenic variants; however, simultaneous kidney and liver transplantation in young children with aHUS and CFH pathogenic variants may correct the genetic defect and prevent disease recurrence. Genetic counseling Predisposition to aHUS associated with pathogenic variants in C3, CD46, CFB, CFH (including CFH hybrid genes), CFHR5, CFI, THBD, or VTN is typically inherited in an autosomal dominant manner with reduced penetrance. Atypical HUS associated with pathogenic variants in DGKE is typically inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Deletions of CFHR3/CFHR1 and CFHR1/CFHR4 are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Polygenic inheritance is also reported in rare families. Autosomal dominant inheritance. Almost all individuals with autosomal dominant aHUS inherited an aHUS-related pathogenic variant from a heterozygous (typically unaffected) parent. Each child of an individual with autosomal dominant aHUS has a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant; offspring who inherit the pathogenic variant may or may not develop aHUS. Autosomal recessive inheritance. If both parents are known to be heterozygous for an autosomal recessive aHUS-related pathogenic variant, each sib of a proband has a 25% chance of inheriting two Atypical Hemolytic-Uremic Syndrome 3 pathogenic variants, a 50% chance of inheriting one pathogenic variant, and a 25% chance of inheriting neither pathogenic variant. Once the aHUS-related pathogenic variant(s) have been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing and preimplantation genetic testing for the familial pathogenic variant(s) are possible."

The dental phenotype unique to HFTC includes enamel hypoplasia, short and bulbous roots, obliteration of pulp chambers and canals, and pulp stones. Less common are large and small vessel calcifications that are often asymptomatic incidental findings on radiologic studies but can also cause peripheral vascular insufficiency (e.g., pain, cold extremities, and decreased peripheral pulses). Less frequently reported findings include testicular microlithiasis and angioid streaks of the retina. Diagnosis/testing HFTC results from a relative deficiency of or resistance to the phosphate-regulating hormone, fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23). The clinical diagnosis of HFTC is established by the presence of tumoral calcinosis and/or characteristic laboratory findings of hyperphosphatemia in the setting of inappropriately increased renal tubular reabsorption of phosphorus (TRP), elevated or inappropriately normal 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25D) levels, and elevated C-terminal FGF23 fragments.

Management GeneReviews Treatment of manifestations: No randomized clinical trials have been performed; studies of the treatment of HFTC consist of case reports or case series. Since FGF23 replacement therapy is not available, treatment relies on lowering blood phosphorus by blocking absorption from the diet (i.e., use of low-phosphate diet and phosphate binders) and/or by increasing renal phosphate excretion (i.e., use of acetazolamide, probenecid, or niacinamide/nicotinamide); however, clinical responses vary. Surgical resection of tumoral calcinosis lesions generally reserved for those patients with significant pain or functional impairment has variable success. Treatment of pain associated with hyperostosis is symptomatic. No data on management of vascular calcification or testicular microlithiasis are available. Surveillance: No specific guidelines address the issue of surveillance in HFTC. The frequency of monitoring depends on the clinical findings and medical treatment, as no data support an appropriate monitoring interval. Agents/circumstances to avoid: It is prudent to avoid: use of calcium salts as phosphate binders; excessive dietary calcium intake; excessive vitamin D intake/supplements; foods high in phosphorus.

Renal replacement therapies (such as hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis) can replace renal function, but are associated with potential complications. Kidney transplantation is curative, as the transplanted kidney does not develop the disease. Surveillance: Childhood/adolescent-onset disease: measurement of hemoglobin concentration and serum concentration of uric acid, bicarbonate, and creatinine at least every six months starting at the time of diagnosis. Adult-onset disease: similar laboratory testing every six to 12 months, depending on the level of kidney function. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, especially in persons who are dehydrated. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors could aggravate the underlying relative renin deficit.

In approximately half of affected individuals, attacks of flaccid muscle weakness begin in the first decade of life, with 25% reporting their first attack at age ten years or older. Initially infrequent, the attacks then increase in frequency and severity over time until approximately age 50 years, after which the frequency of attacks declines considerably. The major attack trigger is eating potassium-rich foods; other triggers include: cold environment; rest after exercise, stress, or fatigue; alcohol; hunger; and changes in activity level. A spontaneous attack commonly starts in the morning before breakfast, lasts for 15 minutes to one hour, and then passes. Individuals with hyperPP frequently have myotonia (muscle stiffness), especially around the time of an episode of weakness. Paramyotonia (muscle stiffness aggravated by cold and exercise) is present in about 45% of affected individuals. More than 80% of individuals with hyperPP older than age 40 years report permanent muscle weakness and about one third develop a chronic progressive myopathy. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of hyperPP is established in a proband with suggestive findings and a heterozygous pathogenic variant in SCN4A identified by molecular genetic testing. In case of diagnostic uncertainty, a provocative test can be employed, although the availability of genetic testing and electrophysiologic studies largely obviates the need for such dangerous tests.

Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of HCC can be established in individuals with typical clinical findings, characteristic abnormalities on brain MRI, and biallelic pathogenic variants in HYCC1 (formerly FAM126A) identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Cataract extraction usually in the first months of life. Therapy support for developmental delays; special education; physical medicine and rehabilitation for spasticity and ataxia. Consider pharmacologic agents for spasticity; anti-seizure medication as needed. Treatment for scoliosis and contractures per orthopedist; feeding therapy and or gastrostomy tube as needed.

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Hypochondroplasia is a skeletal dysplasia characterized by short stature; stocky build; disproportionately short arms and legs; broad, short hands and feet; mild joint laxity; and macrocephaly. Radiologic features include shortening of long bones with mild metaphyseal flare; narrowing of the inferior lumbar interpedicular distances; short, broad femoral neck; and squared, shortened ilia. The skeletal features are very similar to those seen in achondroplasia but tend to be milder. Medical complications common to achondroplasia (e.g., spinal stenosis, tibial bowing, obstructive apnea) occur less frequently in hypochondroplasia but intellectual disability and epilepsy may be more prevalent. Children usually present as toddlers or at early school age with decreased growth velocity leading to short stature and limb disproportion. Other features also become more prominent over time. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of hypochondroplasia is established in a proband with characteristic clinical and radiographic features. Identification of a heterozygous FGFR3 pathogenic variant known to be associated with hypochondroplasia can confirm the diagnosis and help distinguish hypochondroplasia from achondroplasia and other related skeletal dysplasias in individuals with overlapping phenotypes. Management Treatment of manifestations: Management of short stature in hypochondroplasia is influenced by parental expectations and concerns; one approach is to address these concerns rather than trying to treat the child. Suboccipital decompression if neurologic status is affected by spinal cord compression. Treatment for thoracolumbar kyphosis and/or genu varum as per orthopedic surgeon if necessary. Laminectomy relieves symptoms of spinal stenosis; about 70% of individuals experience relief of symptoms following decompression without laminectomy. Epilepsy is treated in the standard fashion.

GeneReviews during early childhood so that cognitive impairments are addressed with special educational programs. Connect family with local resources and support. Surveillance: Height, weight, and head circumference should be monitored using achondroplasia-standardized growth curves. The following should be performed at routine well-child visits: neurologic examination for signs of spinal cord compression, assessment of signs and symptoms of sleep apnea, physical examination for emerging leg bowing, and monitoring of development and social adjustment. MRI or CT examination of the foramen magnum is indicated if there is evidence of severe hypotonia, spinal cord compression, or central sleep apnea. Pregnancy management: Vaginal deliveries are possible, although for each pregnancy, pelvic outlet capacity should be assessed in relation to fetal head size; epidural or spinal anesthetic can be used, but a consultation with an anesthesiologist prior to delivery is recommended to assess the spinal anatomy; spinal stenosis may be aggravated during pregnancy. Genetic counseling Hypochondroplasia is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. The majority of individuals with hypochondroplasia have parents of average stature and have hypochondroplasia as the result of a de novo pathogenic variant. If the proband has a known FGFR3 pathogenic variant that cannot be detected in the leukocyte DNA of either parent and neither parent has an autosomal dominant skeletal dysplasia, the recurrence risk to sibs is estimated to be 1% because of the possibility of parental germline mosaicism. An individual with hypochondroplasia who has a partner of average stature is at a 50% risk of having a child with hypochondroplasia. If an affected individual's partner also has hypochondroplasia (or another dominant form of skeletal dysplasia), genetic counseling becomes more complicated because of (1) the risk for inheriting two dominantly inherited skeletal dysplasias, (2) the high incidence of genetic heterogeneity, and (3) the lack of medical literature addressing these circumstances. Prenatal testing and preimplantation genetic testing are possible if the causative pathogenic variant(s) have been identified in the affected parent(s)."

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Incontinentia pigmenti (IP) is a disorder that affects the skin, hair, teeth, nails, eyes, and central nervous system; it occurs primarily in females and on occasion in males. Characteristic skin lesions evolve through four stages: I. Blistering (birth to age ~4 months) II. Wart-like rash (for several months) III. Swirling macular hyperpigmentation (age ~6 months into adulthood) IV. Linear hypopigmentation Alopecia, hypodontia, abnormal tooth shape, and dystrophic nails are observed. Neovascularization of the retina, present in some individuals, predisposes to retinal detachment. Neurologic findings including seizures, intellectual disability, and developmental delays are occasionally seen. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of IP is established in a proband with at least one major criterion (characteristic skin lesion). Identification of a heterozygous IKBKG pathogenic variant in a female proband or a hemizygous IKBKG pathogenic variant in a male proband confirms the diagnosis if clinical features are inconclusive. Management Treatment of manifestations: Standard management of blisters and skin infections; dental care by a pedodontist; dental implants in childhood as needed; care by a speech pathologist and/or pediatric nutritionist if dental abnormalities interfere with chewing and/or speech; cryotherapy and laser photocoagulation of retinal neovascularization to reduce risk of retinal detachment; standard management of retinal detachment; referral to a pediatric neurologist for management of seizures, spasticity, or focal deficits; brain MRI for functional Author Affiliations: 1 Division of Genetics and Metabolism, Department of Pediatrics, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas; Email: angela.scheuerle@utsouthwestern.edu. 2 Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Institute of Genetics and Biophysics, National Research Council, Naples, Italy; Email: ursini@igb.cnr.it.

GeneReviews neurologic abnormalities and/or retinal neovascularization; developmental programs and special education as needed for developmental delay. Prevention of secondary complications: Standard measures to reduce the risk of skin infection; evaluate for retinal detachment if vision decreases, strabismus appears, or head trauma occurs. Surveillance: Eye examination: monthly until age four months, then every three months from age four months to one year, every six months from age one to three years, and annually after age three years. Assessment of neurologic function at routine visits with pediatrician, pediatric neurologist, or developmental pediatrician; routine evaluation by a pedodontist or dentist. Evaluation of relatives at risk: Identification of affected relatives by physical examination and retinal examination so that screening ophthalmology examinations can be performed. Genetic counseling IP is inherited in an X-linked manner. About 65% of affected individuals have IP as a result of a de novo pathogenic variant. Heterozygous, affected women have a 50% chance of transmitting the IKBKG pathogenic variant at conception; however, male conceptuses with an IKBKG loss-of-function variant miscarry. Thus, the expected ratio among live-born children of a mother with IP is approximately 33% unaffected females, 33% affected females, and 33% unaffected males. To date, all males with IP have had either a 47,XXY karyotype or somatic mosaicism for the IKBKG pathogenic variant. A male with somatic and germline mosaicism may transmit the IKBKG pathogenic variant to daughters (females who inherit the pathogenic variant will be affected); an affected male would not transmit an IKBKG pathogenic variant to sons. Prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible if the familial pathogenic variant has been identified."

Lower-extremity muscle involvement progresses from the anterior to the posterior compartment of the lower leg, followed by hamstrings, then hip girdle muscles, with relative sparing of the quadriceps. A wheelchair may be needed about ten to 20 years after the onset of manifestations. The upper extremities, which may be affected within five to ten years of disease onset, do not necessarily follow a distal-to-proximal progression. In advanced stages, neck and core muscles can become affected. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of GNE myopathy is suspected in a proband with suggestive clinical findings and muscle histopathology (rimmed vacuoles, no inflammation) and is established by the presence of biallelic pathogenic variants in GNE identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Evaluation and management are often by a multidisciplinary team that includes neuromuscular specialists, physiatrists, and physical and occupational therapists to address issues secondary to muscle weakness, including the use of assistive ambulatory devices (e.g., ankle-foot orthoses, cane, walker, wheelchair, or powerchair). Adaptive devices to support fine motor function and activities of daily living are needed in advanced stages of the disease.

Muscle weakness progresses to involve other limb and respiratory muscles. PDB involves focal areas of increased bone turnover that typically lead to spine and/or hip pain and localized enlargement and deformity of the long bones; pathologic fractures occur on occasion. Early stages of FTD are characterized by dysnomia, dyscalculia, comprehension deficits, and paraphasic errors, with minimal impairment of episodic memory; later stages are characterized by inability to speak, auditory comprehension deficits for even one-step commands, alexia, and agraphia. Mean age at diagnosis for muscle disease and PDB is 42 years; for FTD, 56 years.

Clinical characteristics Infection-induced acute encephalopathy 3 (IIAE3) is the susceptibility to recurrent acute necrotizing encephalopathy (ANE) caused by a heterozygous pathogenic variant in RANBP2. ANE refers to the specific neurologic presentation in which bilateral symmetric thalamic, midbrain, and/or hindbrain lesions occur within days following the onset of an acute viral illness caused by influenza A, influenza B, parainfluenza II, human herpes virus 6, coxsackie virus, or an enterovirus. Although most IIAE3 occurs before age six years, first episodes have been observed in teenagers and adults. ANE begins within 12 hours to three or four days of the first awareness of viral symptoms (fever, cough, rhinorrhea, vomiting, diarrhea, and malaise). The most common sign of ANE is lethargy that progresses to coma (which may last for weeks) and seizures (in 50%). One third of affected individuals die during the acute phase of the encephalopathy; of the survivors, one half have permanent neurologic damage and the remainder have no discernible residual symptoms. Fifty per cent of persons with IIAE3 will have at least one repeat episode and some will have multiple repeat episodes Diagnosis/testing IIAE3 is suspected in individuals with typical clinical and MRI findings, and is confirmed in those with a heterozygous pathogenic variant in RANBP2. Management Treatment of manifestations: Treatments for IIAE3 remain anecdotal and it should be noted that patients have recovered without specific intervention.

GeneReviews administration of corticosteroids during an acute episode of encephalopathy (not supported by data from IIAE-3-specific studies) as well as IVIg, plasmapheresis, and TNF antagonists with varied, but overall limited, therapeutic effects. Prevention of primary manifestations: Routine vaccinations and yearly influenza vaccinations are recommended, although there are theoretic concerns for live influenza and cellular pertussis preparations. No studies have suggested that vaccinations cause acute necrotizing encephalopathy (ANE) in an individual heterozygous for an RANBP2 pathogenic variant. Surveillance: No standard tests allow prediction of the triggering of an ANE event or progression of an event once one occurs. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Avoid individuals who are ill with an infectious disease and adhere to strict precautions regarding hand washing. Based on a single case report of ANE in one individual (not known to have a RANBP2 pathogenic variant), avoidance of cellular pertussis in DTaP immunization is recommended. Evaluation of relatives at risk: In a family with IIAE3, molecular genetic testing of at-risk first-degree relatives, especially children, is warranted so that those who have inherited the RANBP2 pathogenic variant can benefit from prompt intervention in the early stages of ANE. Genetic counseling Susceptibility to IIAE3 is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. To date the majority of individuals diagnosed with IIAE3 have a parent who is heterozygous for a RANBP2 pathogenic variant; however, due to reduced penetrance, the parent may not have manifested the disease state. Also, a proband with susceptibility to IIAE3 may have the disorder as the result of a de novo pathogenic variant. Each child of an individual with susceptibility to IIAE3 has a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant. When the RANBP2 pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk is possible."

Steroid doses should be optimized to allow for linear growth without risking an adrenal crisis. Consider assessment for growth hormone deficiency to determine if growth hormone should be considered. Routine management of cryptorchidism and hypospadias by a urologist, and routine hormone replacement by an endocrinologist for hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. Management by an orthopedist as needed for skeletal complications such as scoliosis and hip dysplasia. Occupational, speech, and/or physical therapy as needed, particularly in those with hypotonia. Surveillance: Growth assessment at each visit; annual evaluations by an endocrinologist to monitor adrenal function and for development of hypercalciuria and nephrocalcinosis; evaluation as needed by an orthopedist to monitor for skeletal complications as needed; assessment of hypotonia, developmental progress, and educational needs at each visit. Evaluation of relatives at risk: To allow early diagnosis and management of adrenal insufficiency in at-risk newborns, molecular genetic testing should be pursued if the CDKN1C pathogenic variant in the family is known; if the familial pathogenic variant is not known, screen for serum electrolyte abnormalities, elevated serum ACTH level, and skeletal features of IMAGe syndrome. Pregnancy management: Risks to a mother with IMAGe syndrome during pregnancy include possible adrenal insufficiency; risks during delivery include cephalopelvic disproportion. Genetic counseling Typically, a CDKN1C pathogenic variant causing IMAGe syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner; however, only maternal transmission of the pathogenic variant results in IMAGe syndrome. Each child of a woman with a heterozygous pathogenic CDKN1C variant has a 50% chance of inheriting the variant and being affected. Each child of a man with a heterozygous pathogenic CDKN1C variant has a 50% chance of inheriting the variant but is expected to be unaffected. If the pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing is possible for a pregnancy at increased risk (i.e., when the mother has the pathogenic variant)."

Many affected children never learn to walk or lose the ability shortly after attaining it. Strabismus, nystagmus, and optic atrophy are common. Disease progression is rapid, resulting in severe spasticity, progressive cognitive decline, and visual impairment. Many affected children do not survive beyond their first decade. Atypical NAD shows more phenotypic variability than INAD. In general, onset is in early childhood but can be as late as the end of the second decade. The presenting signs may be gait instability, ataxia, or speech delay and autistic features, which are sometimes the only evidence of disease for a year or more. Strabismus, nystagmus, and optic atrophy are common. Neuropsychiatric disturbances including impulsivity, poor attention span, hyperactivity, and emotional lability are also common. The course is fairly stable during early childhood and resembles static encephalopathy but is followed by neurologic deterioration between ages seven and 12 years. PLA2G6-related dystonia-parkinsonism has a variable age of onset, but most individuals present in early adulthood with gait disturbance or neuropsychiatric changes. Affected individuals consistently develop dystonia and parkinsonism (which may be accompanied by rapid cognitive decline) in their late teens to early twenties.

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics INSR-related severe insulin resistance syndrome (INSR-SIRS) comprises a phenotypic spectrum that is a continuum from the severe phenotype of Donohue syndrome to the milder phenotype of Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome (RMS). Donohue syndrome is characterized by severe insulin resistance (hyperinsulinemia with associated fasting hypoglycemia and postprandial hyperglycemia), severe prenatal growth restriction, postnatal growth failure, hypotonia, developmental delay, characteristic facies (proptosis, infraorbital folds, large, low-set, posteriorly rotated ears, thick vermilion of the upper and lower lips, and gingival hypertrophy), and organomegaly involving the heart, kidneys, liver, spleen, and ovaries. Death usually occurs before age one year. RMS, at the milder end of the spectrum, is characterized by severe insulin resistance that, although not as severe as that of Donohue syndrome, is nonetheless accompanied by fluctuations in blood glucose levels, diabetic ketoacidosis, and in the second decade microvascular complications. Findings can range from severe growth delay and intellectual disability to normal growth and development. Facial features can be milder than those of Donohue syndrome. Complications of longstanding hyperglycemia are the most common cause of death. While death usually occurs in the second decade, some affected individuals live longer.

Management GeneReviews Treatment of manifestations: Donohue syndrome: no effective treatments for insulin resistance or other manifestations of Donohue syndrome are currently available. Frequent feedings as well as increased protein content of evening feedings can help prevent fasting hypoglycemia. RMS: Insulin sensitizers are used first to decrease levels of glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c); however, their effect diminishes with time, often requiring dose adjustments and multidrug therapy. When hyperglycemia persists, insulin is started usually in high doses, especially during the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis. Standard treatment for hypothyroidism; oral contraceptives, antiandrogen therapies, and gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists can be used to treat hyperandrogenism; oophorectomy may be needed for enlarged ovaries; nutritional, developmental, and educational support; rigorous workup and treatment of intercurrent infections; beta-blockers for cardiomyopathy; treatment of nephrocalcinosis per nephrologist; treatment of cholestasis per gastroenterologist; treatment of rectal prolapse per surgeon; standard treatments for malignancies; social work and family support. Surveillance: Capillary glucose levels during fasting and after feeding, when clinically indicated, or continuous monitoring; HbA1c, insulin, and C-peptide levels every three months; thyroid function and hyperandrogenism lab assessment every six months or as clinically indicated; ovarian ultrasound every three months until age two years, then every six months or as indicated; nutrition and growth assessment at each visit; assess psychomotor development every three months; assess for recurrent infections at each visit; echocardiogram and cardiac MRI every six months (each test alternating every three months) until age two years, then annually (each test alternating every six months) or as indicated; urine calcium and kidney ultrasound every six months; gynecologic evaluation for endometrial cancer in those with abnormal vaginal bleeding. Agents/circumstances to avoid: In Donohue syndrome, avoid agents that cause hypoglycemia, prolonged fasting, and contact with persons with contagious disease. In RMS avoid agents that cause hypoglycemia, high- carbohydrate diet, and contact with persons with contagious disease. Genetic counseling INSR-SIRS is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. If both parents are known to be heterozygous for an INSR pathogenic variant, each sib of an affected individual has at conception a 25% chance of inheriting biallelic pathogenic variants and being affected with INSR-SIRS, a 50% chance of inheriting one pathogenic variant and being heterozygous, and a 25% chance of inheriting neither of the familial INSR pathogenic variants. Heterozygotes are usually asymptomatic but may have features of the allelic disorder type A insulin resistance. Once the INSR pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member, heterozygote testing for at-risk relatives and prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing are possible. (Of note: Heterozygotes for an INSR pathogenic variant are at increased risk for gestational diabetes and require monitoring for glucose intolerance before and during pregnancy.)"

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics AIP familial isolated pituitary adenoma (AIP-FIPA) is defined as the presence of an AIP germline pathogenic variant in an individual with a pituitary adenoma (regardless of family history). The most commonly occurring pituitary adenomas in this disorder are growth hormone-secreting adenomas (somatotropinoma), followed by prolactin-secreting adenomas (prolactinoma), growth hormone and prolactin co-secreting adenomas (somatomammotropinoma), and nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas (NFPA). Rarely TSH-secreting adenomas (thyrotropinomas) are observed. Clinical findings result from excess hormone secretion, lack of hormone secretion, and/or mass effects (e.g., headaches, visual field loss). Within the same family, pituitary adenomas can be of the same or different type. Age of onset in AIP-FIPA is usually in the second or third decade. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of AIP-FIPA is established in a proband with a pituitary adenoma by identification of a heterozygous germline pathogenic variant in AIP by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Pituitary adenomas identified in those with AIP-FIPA are generally treated in the same manner as pituitary adenomas of unknown cause: they can be treated by medical therapy (somatostatin analogs, growth hormone receptor antagonists, and dopamine agonists), surgery, and/or radiotherapy. Although surgery is usually performed in persons with AIP-FIPA, it often does not fully control the tumor; thus, medical therapy and radiotherapy following surgery may be required to control hormone output and tumor growth. AIP- FIPA adenomas often do not respond well to first-generation somatostatin analog, while data suggest that they may respond better to second-generation multi-ligand agonists.

GeneReviews agonist therapy or surgery and can be aggressive and difficult to treat. NFPA is treated with surgery and if necessary radiotherapy. Prevention of secondary complications: Expert management for hypopituitarism which can be due to tumor size, surgery, or radiotherapy. Persons on glucocorticoid replacement therapy need to increase their steroid dose when ill or stressed. Surveillance: In asymptomatic individuals: annual growth assessment and evaluation for signs/symptoms of pituitary adenoma and pubertal development from age four years until adulthood. Continue annual evaluation for signs and symptoms of pituitary adenoma until age 30 years and then every five years between ages 30 and 50 years. Annual pituitary function tests (serum IGF-1, prolactin, estradiol/testosterone, LH, FSH, TSH, free T4) beginning at age four years until age 30; pituitary MRI at age ten years and repeated (every 5 years has been suggested) or as necessary based on clinical and biochemical parameters until age 30 years. Starting at age 30 to 50 years surveillance can be relaxed. In symptomatic individuals: annual clinical assessment and pituitary function tests (serum IGF-1, spot growth hormone, prolactin, estradiol/testosterone, LH, FSH, TSH, free T4, and morning cortisol); if indicated annual dynamic testing to evaluate for hormone excess or deficiency (e.g., glucose tolerance test, insulin tolerance test); pituitary MRI with frequency depending on clinical status, previous extent of the tumor, and treatment modality. Clinical monitoring of secondary complications of the tumor and/or its treatment (e.g., diabetes mellitus, hypertension, osteoarthritis, hypogonadism, osteoporosis); in those with acromegaly, colonoscopy at age 40 years and repeated every three to ten years depending on the number of colorectal lesions and IGF-1 levels. Evaluation of relatives at risk: Family members at risk for AIP-FIPA warrant molecular genetic testing for the family-specific pathogenic variant to identify those who harbor the variant and thus require surveillance for pituitary adenomas. Genetic counseling AIP-FIPA is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Each child of an individual with AIP-FIPA has a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant. Prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk is possible if the AIP pathogenic variant of an affected family member has been identified; however, because AIP-FIPA demonstrates reduced penetrance, the finding of an AIP pathogenic variant prenatally does not allow accurate prediction of whether a tumor will develop, or the type of adenoma, age of onset, prognosis, or availability and/or outcome of treatment."

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics IPEX (immune dysregulation, polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy, X-linked) syndrome is characterized by systemic autoimmunity, typically beginning in the first year of life, which includes the triad of enteropathy (manifesting as malabsorption and watery diarrhea), endocrinopathy (most commonly type 1 insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus), and eczematous dermatitis. In addition to these manifestations, many children have other autoimmune phenomena including cytopenias, autoimmune hepatitis, nephropathy, lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, alopecia, arthritis, and interstitial lung disease related to immune dysregulation. Fetal presentation of IPEX syndrome includes hydrops, echogenic bowel, skin desquamation, intrauterine growth deficiency, and fetal akinesia. Without aggressive immunosuppression or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), the majority of affected males will die within the first one to two years of life from metabolic derangements, severe malabsorption, or sepsis. Individuals with a milder phenotype have survived into the second or third decade of life, but this is uncommon. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis is established in a male proband with typical clinical findings, absent regulatory T cells (Treg) in blood or tissues, decreased numbers of FOXP3-expressing T cells in peripheral blood determined by flow cytometry (although FOXP3 levels in Treg can be normal in some individuals), and a hemizygous pathogenic variant in FOXP3 identified by molecular genetic testing. Heterozygous females have not been reported to have clinical findings typical of IPEX syndrome. Management Targeted therapies: HSCT offers the only potential cure for IPEX syndrome. T cell-directed immune suppression can include either an mTOR inhibitor (sirolimus) or calcineurin inhibitor (cyclosporin A or tacrolimus), alone or in combination with corticosteroids.

GeneReviews Supportive care: Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) with fluids and electrolyte support is needed until intestinal function can be established with immune suppression. Treatment of type 1 insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus with insulin and carbohydrate management is standard, as is management of autoimmune thyroid disease. Skin conditions are managed with topical therapies, which can include steroids, tacrolimus, and emollients. Autoimmune neutropenia has been successfully treated with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor; pemphigus nodularis has been treated with rituximab (anti-CD20), and rituximab has been used for other autoantibody- mediated disease. Prophylactic antibiotic therapy may be required for autoimmune neutropenia or recurrent infections with central venous access and TPN. Aggressive management of dermatitis with topical steroids and anti-inflammatory agents as needed to prevent cutaneous infections. Surveillance: Monitor growth, nutritional intake, and stooling patterns at each visit; glucose tolerance test, hemoglobin A1c, and thyroid function tests every three to six months; skin exam at each visit; complete blood count, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, urinalysis, and serum aspartate transaminase and alanine transaminase every three to six months. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Withhold immunizations until after HSCT, if possible. Evaluation of relatives at risk: It is appropriate to clarify the genetic status of at-risk males either prenatally or immediately after birth to enable early diagnosis and HSCT and/or immune suppression treatment in affected males before significant organ damage occurs. Genetic counseling IPEX syndrome is inherited in an X-linked manner. The risk to sibs of the proband depends on the genetic status of the mother. If the mother of the proband has a FOXP3 pathogenic variant, the chance of transmitting the pathogenic variant in each pregnancy is 50%. Males who inherit the pathogenic variant will be affected; females who inherit the pathogenic variant will be heterozygous (to date, IPEX syndrome has not been reported in females who are heterozygous for a FOXP3 pathogenic variant). Affected males transmit the pathogenic variant to all of their daughters and none of their sons. Once the FOXP3 pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, identification of female heterozygotes and prenatal/preimplantation genetic testing are possible."

Classic ISOD is characterized in the first few hours to days of life by intractable seizures, feeding difficulties, and rapidly progressive encephalopathy manifest as abnormal tone (especially opisthotonus, spastic quadriplegia, and pyramidal signs) followed by progressive microcephaly and profound intellectual disability. Lens subluxation or dislocation, another characteristic finding, may be evident after the newborn period. Children usually die during the first few months of life. Late-onset ISOD manifests between ages six and 18 months and is characterized by ectopia lentis (variably present), developmental delay/regression, movement disorder characterized by dystonia and choreoathetosis, ataxia, and (rarely) acute hemiplegia as a result of metabolic stroke. The clinical course may be progressive or episodic. In the episodic form encephalopathy, dystonia, choreoathetosis, and/or ataxia are intermittent. Diagnosis/testing Laboratory findings that suggest the diagnosis of ISOD are dipstick positive for urinary sulfite, elevated urinary thiosulfate and S-sulfocysteine, low urinary organic sulfate, and markedly reduced plasma levels of total homocysteine. The diagnosis is confirmed by identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in SUOX by molecular genetic testing.

Classic IVA is characterized by acute metabolic decompensations (vomiting, poor feeding, lethargy, hypotonia, seizures, and a distinct odor of sweaty feet). Acute metabolic decompensations are typically triggered by fasting, (febrile) illness (especially gastroenteritis), or increased protein intake. Clinical deterioration often occurs within hours to days after birth. Additional manifestations of classic IVA include developmental delay, intellectual disability and/or impaired cognition, epilepsy, and movement disorder (tremor, dysmetria, extrapyramidal movements).

Historically, FSASD was divided into separate allelic disorders: Salla disease, intermediate severe Salla disease, and infantile free sialic acid storage disease (ISSD). The mildest type was Salla disease, characterized by normal appearance and absence of neurologic findings at birth, followed by slowly progressive neurologic deterioration resulting in mild-to-moderate psychomotor delays, spasticity, athetosis, and epileptic seizures. Salla disease was named for a municipality in Finnish Lapland where a specific founder variant is relatively prevalent.

Males and females are equally affected. Prominent clinical features include hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, cardiomyopathy, glucose intolerance and diabetes, arthropathy, and liver fibrosis or cirrhosis. Hepatocellular cancer has been reported occasionally. The main cause of death is cardiac disease. If juvenile hemochromatosis is detected early enough and if blood is removed regularly through the process of phlebotomy to achieve iron depletion, morbidity and mortality are greatly reduced. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of juvenile hemochromatosis is established in a proband with clinical and laboratory features of iron overload by identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in HAMP or HJV on molecular genetic testing. Individuals with suggestive features of juvenile hemochromatosis who do not have biallelic HAMP or HJV pathogenic variants identified on molecular genetic testing should have further evaluation by imaging and/or liver biopsy. Management Treatment of manifestations: Phlebotomy for treatment of iron overload as for HFE hemochromatosis: phlebotomy of 1 unit of blood (~200 mg of iron) 1x/week for up to 2-3 years to reduce iron stores to desired levels (serum ferritin concentration ~50 ng/mL), followed by phlebotomies to maintain normal serum iron levels. Conventional treatment of secondary complications including hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, arthropathy, cardiac failure, liver disease, and diabetes mellitus as indicated.

GeneReviews is treated with analgesics and NSAIDs. Cardiac failure and arrhythmias require treatment as per cardiologist. Glucose intolerance or diabetes may require oral agents or insulin administration. Prevention of primary manifestations: Individuals with biochemical evidence of iron overload but without evidence of organ dysfunction or failure should be encouraged to undergo regular phlebotomies until excess iron stores are depleted to prevent the development of complications associated with excess iron stores. Prevention of secondary complications: Hormone replacement therapy may prevent osteoporosis. Surveillance: Monitor those at risk with annual measurement of serum ferritin concentration and transferrin saturation starting in early childhood. For individuals with iron overload: serum ferritin every 4-8 phlebotomies during the induction phase; every 1-2 phlebotomies as ferritin levels approach the target of 50 ng/mL; liver function tests and fibroelastography every 6-24 months according to severity of liver dysfunction; abdominal ultrasound and serum alpha-fetoprotein concentration every 6 months in those with severe fibrosis or cirrhosis to monitor for hepatocellular cancer; cardiac ultrasound and MR-based quantitation of iron according to the severity of cardiac dysfunction; Holter EKG as needed to evaluate for arrhythmias; serum FSH, LH, and testosterone or estradiol every 12 months or as needed; fasting and postprandial serum glucose and Hgb A1c every 6-12 months according to needs; vitamin D, PTH, serum and urinary calcium and phosphorus, C- terminal telopeptide every 12 months according to needs; DXA every 24 months or as needed. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Alcohol consumption; ingestion of iron-containing preparations and supplemental vitamin C; handling or eating uncooked shellfish or marine fish because of risk of fatal septicemia from the marine bacterium V vulnificus. Evaluation of relatives at risk: It is appropriate to clarify the clinical/genetic status of all at-risk family members (i.e., sibs) of an affected individual in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from early monitoring for the development of iron overload. If juvenile hemochromatosis is detected before evidence of organ damage, treatment via phlebotomy can reverse or prevent many of the secondary complications resulting from organ damage. Evaluation can include serum iron indices (i.e., serum iron, transferrin saturation, and serum ferritin), serum transaminases, C-reactive protein, and molecular genetic testing in relatives at risk before evidence of organ damage from iron overload.

Prolongation of the QTc interval is associated with tachyarrhythmias, including ventricular tachycardia, episodes of torsade de pointes ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation, which may culminate in syncope or sudden death. Iron-deficient anemia and elevated levels of gastrin are also frequent features of JLNS. The classic presentation of JLNS is a deaf child who experiences syncopal episodes during periods of stress, exercise, or fright. Fifty percent of individuals with JLNS had cardiac events before age three years. More than half of untreated children with JLNS die before age 15 years. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of JLNS is established in a child with congenital sensorineural deafness, long QT interval, and presence of biallelic pathogenic variants in either KCNQ1 or KCNE1.

Cognitive abilities are variable, ranging from severe intellectual disability to normal. Additional findings can include retinal dystrophy, renal disease, ocular colobomas, occipital encephalocele, hepatic fibrosis, polydactyly, oral hamartomas, and endocrine abnormalities. Both intra- and interfamilial variation are seen. Diagnosis/testing The clinical diagnosis of JS is based on the presence of characteristic clinical features and MRI findings.

A molecular diagnosis of JS can be established in about 62%-94% of individuals with a clinical diagnosis of JS by identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in one of the 33 autosomal recessive JS-related genes or a heterozygous pathogenic variant in the one X-linked JS-related gene. Management Treatment of manifestations: Infants and children with abnormal breathing may require stimulatory medications (e.g., caffeine); supplemental oxygen; mechanical support; or tracheostomy in rare cases.

Genetic counseling JS is predominantly inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. JS caused by pathogenic variants in OFD1 is inherited in an X-linked manner. Digenic inheritance has been reported. For autosomal recessive inheritance: at conception, each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Once the pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member, carrier testing for at-risk family members, prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk, and preimplantation genetic testing are possible. For pregnancies known to be at increased risk for JS, prenatal diagnosis by ultrasound examination with or without fetal MRI has been successful."

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Juvenile polyposis syndrome (JPS) is characterized by predisposition to hamartomatous polyps in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, specifically in the stomach, small intestine, colon, and rectum. The term \\\"juvenile\\\" refers to the type of polyp rather than to the age of onset of polyps. Most individuals with JPS have some polyps by age 20 years; some may have only four or five polyps over their lifetime, whereas others in the same family may have more than 100. If the polyps are left untreated, they may cause bleeding and anemia. Most juvenile polyps are benign; however, malignant transformation can occur. Risk for GI cancers ranges from 11% to 86%. Most of this increased risk is attributed to colon cancer, but cancers of the stomach, upper GI tract, and pancreas have also been reported. A combined syndrome of JPS and hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is present in most individuals with an SMAD4 pathogenic variant. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of JPS is established in a proband with any of the following: more than five juvenile polyps of the colorectum; multiple juvenile polyps throughout the GI tract; or any number of juvenile polyps and a family history of juvenile polyposis. Identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in SMAD4 or BMPR1A confirms the diagnosis if clinical features are inconclusive. Management Treatment of manifestations: Colonoscopy with endoscopic polypectomy to reduce the risk of cancer, bleeding, and intestinal obstruction. When a large number of polyps are present, removal of all or part of the colon or stomach may be necessary. Iron replacement and red blood cell transfusion as needed for anemia; treatment as needed for manifestations of HHT, arteriovenous malformations, aortopathy, and/or valvular disease per cardiologist and cardiothoracic surgeon.

GeneReviews Surveillance: Assess for rectal bleeding, anemia, abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, or change in stool size, shape, and/or color at each visit; complete blood count as needed based on symptoms; colonoscopy and upper endoscopy every three years beginning at age 15 years or earlier if symptomatic or if polyps were present on the prior colonoscopy. For individuals following surgical resection: endoscopic evaluation of the remaining colon, rectum, and ileal pouch. In individuals with (or at risk for) SMAD4-related JPS, follow HHT surveillance guidelines and consider transthoracic echocardiogram. Evaluation of relatives at risk: It is appropriate to evaluate apparently asymptomatic older and younger at-risk relatives of an affected individual in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from early surveillance and intervention. Evaluations include molecular genetic testing (if the pathogenic variant in the family is known) and gastrointestinal and hematologic evaluations if the pathogenic variant in the family is not known. Genetic counseling JPS is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Up to half of individuals with JPS have an affected parent; approximately 50% of probands with JPS have no previous history of polyps in the family and may have the disorder as the result of a de novo pathogenic variant. Each child of an affected individual has a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant and developing JPS. Prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible if the pathogenic variant in the family is known."

In the rare case that a parent of the proband is affected, the risk to the sibs is 50%. X-linked inheritance: If the mother of the proband has a KDM6A pathogenic variant, the chance of transmitting it in each pregnancy is 50%. Males who inherit the pathogenic variant will be affected; females who inherit the pathogenic variant will be heterozygous and may have features of KS. Once the causative pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing for KS are possible."

Additional common features include joint contractures, kyphoscoliosis, coxa valga, and laryngomalacia. Cardiac disease and hepatoblastoma have also been reported. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of Kagami-Ogata syndrome is established in a proband with suggestive findings and findings on molecular genetic testing that suggest deficient expression of the RTL1 antisense (RTL1as) allele of maternal origin due to one of the following: paternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 14; epimutation (hypermethylation) affecting the normally unmethylated MEG3/DLK1 intergenic differentially methylated region (MEG3/DLK1:IG-DMR) and MEG3 transcription start site DMR (MEG3:TSS-DMR) on the maternal allele; deletion of the maternally inherited 14q32.2 region that includes MEG3/DLK1:IG-DMR and/or MEG3:TSS-DMR, and may include RTL1as; deletion of the maternally inherited RTL1as but not MEG3/ DLK1:IG-DMR or MEG3:TSS-DMR; translocation (or inversion) disrupting the integrity between the maternally inherited MEG3 promoter at the MEG3:TSS-DMR and RTL1as. Management Treatment of manifestations: Developmental and educational support; mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy as needed after birth; tracheostomy as required; monitor and treat upper and lower respiratory tract infections; treatment of scoliosis per orthopedist; treatment of joint contractures per rehabilitation medicine specialist; tube feeding typically required for poor weight gain; gastrostomy tube feeding as needed; feeding training; treatment of cardiac disease per cardiologist; standard treatment of hepatoblastoma with surgery and chemotherapy; social work and family support.

Echocardiogram annually; abdominal ultrasound and serum alpha-fetoprotein every three months until age three to four years. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Avoid exposure to respiratory infections; individuals with Kagami-Ogata syndrome may develop respiratory failure with respiratory infections, especially during infancy. Genetic counseling The recurrence risk of Kagami-Ogata syndrome is dependent on the genetic mechanism underlying deficient expression of the maternal RTL1as allele in the proband. In most affected individuals, the underlying genetic mechanism occurs as a de novo event and the recurrence risk to sibs is not increased. Less commonly, a parent of a proband has a predisposing genetic alteration associated with an increased recurrence risk to sibs. Recurrence of Kagami-Ogata syndrome has been reported in sibs with maternally derived deletions. If a deletion or translocation involving the chromosome 14q32.2 imprinted region has been identified in the proband, prenatal testing and preimplantation genetic testing are possible. Methylation testing of fetal DNA to examine abnormal methylation patterns of the DMRs (MEG3/DLK1:IG-DMR and MEG3:TSS-DMR) is not recommended; while DNA extracted from amniotic fluid is currently believed to provide the most reliable tissue source for evaluating fetal methylation status, false negative findings have been reported."

Genetic counseling GeneReviews KCNK9 imprinting syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant maternally imprinted manner (i.e., a heterozygous pathogenic variant on the maternally derived KCNK9 allele results in disease; a pathogenic variant on the paternally derived KCNK9 allele does not result in disease because normally the paternally derived KCNK9 allele is silenced). The KCNK9 pathogenic variant can either be inherited from the mother (80%) or arise de novo on the maternally derived KCNK9 allele (20%).

An additional KCNQ3-related neurodevelopmental disorder (NDD) with and without epilepsy has also been described. In KCNQ3-SLFNE, seizures begin in an otherwise healthy infant between age days two and eight of life and spontaneously disappear within the first year of life. Seizures are generally brief, lasting one to two minutes. Seizure types include tonic or apneic episodes and focal clonic activity, with or without autonomic changes. Motor activity may be confined to one body part, migrate to other regions, or generalize. Infants are normal between seizures and feed normally. In KCNQ3-SLFIE, seizures start in the first year of life beyond the neonatal period and disappear after age one to two years. Seizures are generally brief, lasting two minutes; they appear as daily repeated clusters. Seizure types are usually focal, but can also include generalized, causing diffuse hypertonia with jerks of the limbs, head deviation, or motor arrest with unconsciousness and cyanosis. Infants are normal between seizures and psychomotor development is usually normal. In KCNQ3-NDD, individuals present with intellectual disability with or without seizures and/or cortical visual impairment. As little clinical information on these individuals is available, the clinical presentation of KCNQ3- NDD remains to be defined.

Diagnosis/testing GeneReviews The diagnosis of a KCNQ3-related disorder is established in a proband with suggestive findings and at least one heterozygous pathogenic variant in KCNQ3 identified by molecular genetic testing. Rarely, affected individuals have biallelic pathogenic variants in KCNQ3. Management Treatment of manifestations: The seizures of KCNQ3-SLFNE are generally controlled with anti-seizure medications (ASMs) including phenobarbital and phenytoin or carbamazepine, usually withdrawn at age three to six months. The seizures of KCNQ3-SLFIE are usually completely controlled with adequate doses of phenobarbital, carbamazepine, or valproate. In rare instances of seizure recurrence, the starting dose of ASM is often low. ASMs are usually withdrawn after one to three years. KCNQ3-NDD is managed using standard evaluations, therapies, and educational support tailored to the individual's needs. Surveillance: In children with KCNQ3-SLFNE, EEGs at onset and age three, 12, and 24 months are recommended; the EEG at 24 months should be normal. In children with KCNQ3-SLFIE, EEGs at onset and age 12, 24, and 36 months are recommended; the EEG at 36 months should be normal. Pregnancy management: The management of a pregnant woman with a KCNQ3 pathogenic variant is the same as that for any other pregnant woman with a seizure disorder or at increased risk for a seizure disorder: (1) no ASM is required if the woman has been seizure-free or if the woman has no history of seizures; and (2) ASM may be continued for epilepsy that is active during pregnancy. Genetic counseling KCNQ3-SLFNE and KCNQ3-SLFIE are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner; most individuals have an affected parent, or a parent known to have been symptomatic in infancy. KCNQ3-NDD typically occurs as an autosomal dominant disorder caused by a de novo pathogenic variant. Rarely, KCNQ3-NDD is caused by biallelic pathogenic variants and inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Autosomal dominant inheritance: Each child of an individual with KCNQ3-SLFNE, KCNQ3-SLFIE, or autosomal dominant KCNQ3-NDD has a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant. Autosomal recessive inheritance: If both parents of a child with autosomal recessive KCNQ3-NDD are known to be heterozygous for a KCNQ3 pathogenic variant, each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being affected at conception, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% of being asymptomatic and not a carrier. Once the KCNQ3 pathogenic variant(s) have been identified in an affected family member, prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing are possible."

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics KCNT1-related epilepsy is most often associated with two phenotypes: epilepsy of infancy with migrating focal seizures (EIMFS) and autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (ADNFLE). EIMFS is characterized by seizures, typically focal and asynchronous, beginning in the first six months of life with associated developmental plateau or regression. Autonomic manifestations (e.g., perioral cyanosis, flushing, apnea) are common. Seizures are intractable to multiple anticonvulsants and progress to become nearly continuous by age six to nine months. ADNFLE is characterized by clusters of nocturnal motor seizures that vary from simple arousals to hyperkinetic events with tonic or dystonic features. Individuals with KCNT1-related ADNFLE are more likely to develop seizures at a younger age, have cognitive comorbidity, and display psychiatric and behavioral problems than individuals with ADNFLE resulting from other causes. Less common seizure phenotypes in individuals with KCNT1-related epilepsy include West syndrome, Ohtahara syndrome, early myoclonic encephalopathy, leukodystrophy and/or leukoencephalopathy, focal epilepsy, and multifocal epilepsy. Additional neurologic features include hypotonia, microcephaly developing by age 12 months, strabismus, profound developmental delay, and additional movement disorders. Other systemic manifestations including pulmonary hemorrhage caused by prominent systemic-to-pulmonary collateral arteries or cardiac arrhythmia have been reported. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of KCNT1-related epilepsy is established in a proband with intractable epilepsy and a heterozygous pathogenic variant in KCNT1 identified by molecular genetic testing.

Management GeneReviews Treatment of manifestations: KCNT1-related epilepsy is often refractory to conventional anticonvulsants; stiripentol, benzodiazepines, levetiracetam, and the ketogenic diet have all been well tolerated with limited success; quinidine has been used as an off-label anticonvulsant with success in some individuals; in rare cases of pulmonary hemorrhage as a result of systemic pulmonary collaterals, embolization has been recommended; developmental support is appropriate. Surveillance: EEG at intervals determined by seizure frequency and progression, for evaluation of new involuntary movements or unexplained, paroxysmal changes in vital signs, or following adjustments to an anticonvulsant regimen; monitoring of development. Agents/circumstances to avoid: For individuals with ADNFLE, activities in which a sudden loss of consciousness could lead to injury or death should be avoided (e.g., bathing, swimming, driving, or working/playing at heights). Pregnancy management: For women with ADNFLE, a discussion of the risks and benefits of using a given anti- seizure medication during pregnancy should ideally take place before conception. Transitioning to a lower-risk medication prior to pregnancy may be possible. Genetic counseling KCNT1-related epilepsy is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. The majority of affected individuals represent simplex cases (i.e., a single occurrence in a family) resulting from a de novo KCNT1 pathogenic variant. The proportion of cases caused by a de novo pathogenic variant varies by phenotype. All individuals diagnosed with KCNT1-related epilepsy of infancy with migrating focal seizures (EIMFS) have the disorder as the result of a de novo pathogenic variant or an inherited variant from an unaffected parent with somatic and/or germline mosaicism. Some individuals diagnosed with KCNT1-related autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (ADNFLE) have an affected parent. Each child of an individual with KCNT1-related epilepsy has a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant, and intrafamilial clinical variability and reduced penetrance have been reported. Prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible if the pathogenic variant in the family is known."

Management Treatment of manifestations: Use of braces and walkers for ambulation as needed as the disease progresses; standard treatments for dysarthria and dysphagia; breast reduction surgery for gynecomastia as needed; standard treatment per cardiologist and/or endocrinologist for cardiac manifestations and metabolic syndrome; psychosocial support and education to decrease stress and burden on caregivers. Surveillance: Annual assessment of strength, mobility, activities of daily living, speech, and feeding issues; annual assessment of pulmonary function in those with advanced disease; annual assessment of cholesterol and triglycerides, with hepatic function testing if elevated; annual assessment of cardiovascular health per cardiologist; assessment of need for family and caregiver support. Other: Clinical trials of anti-androgen drugs (e.g., leuprorelin) did not consistently reveal significant efficacy, but leuprorelin was efficacious as a treatment for dysphagia in a follow-up clinical trial in Japan, leading to its approval in Japan but not elsewhere. Based on animal studies, administration of testosterone and its analogs may worsen motor neuron disease.

The majority of individuals function in the moderate-to-severe spectrum of intellectual disability although a few individuals have mild delay and total IQ within low-normal range. While most have severe expressive speech delay with little speech development, general language development is usually at a higher level, making nonverbal communication possible. A complex pattern of other findings can also be observed; these include heart defects, renal/urologic defects, genital defects in males, severe respiratory infections, epilepsy / febrile seizures, psychiatric disorders, and extreme apathy or catatonic-like features after puberty. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of Kleefstra syndrome is established in a proband who has a heterozygous deletion at chromosome 9q34.3 that includes at least part of EHMT1 (~50%) or a heterozygous intragenic EHMT1 pathogenic variant (~50%). Management Treatment of manifestations: Ongoing routine care by a multidisciplinary team specializing in the care of children or adults with intellectual disability. Referral to age-appropriate early-childhood intervention programs, special education programs, or vocational training; speech-language therapy, physical and occupational therapy, and sensory integration therapy; specialized care for those with extreme behavior issues, movement disorders, sleep disorders, and/or epilepsy; standard treatment for vision, hearing, cardiac, renal, urologic, and other medical issues.

Genetic counseling GeneReviews Kleefstra syndrome, caused by a deletion at 9q34.3 or pathogenic variants in EHMT1, is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Almost all cases reported to date have been de novo; rarely, recurrence in a family has been reported when a parent has a balanced translocation involving the 9q34.3 region or somatic mosaicism for an interstitial 9q34.3 deletion. Except for individuals with somatic mosaicism for a 9q34.3 deletion, no individuals with Kleefstra syndrome have been known to reproduce. Prenatal testing may be offered to unaffected parents of a child with a 9q34.3 deletion or an EHMT1 pathogenic variant because of the increased risk of recurrence associated with the possibility of germline mosaicism, somatic mosaicism including the germline, or a balanced chromosome translocation."

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics KMT2B-related dystonia (DYT-KMT2B) is a complex childhood-onset (mean age 7 years) movement disorder described to date in 39 individuals. It is characterized by a progressive disease course evolving commonly from lower-limb focal dystonia into generalized dystonia with prominent cervical, cranial, and laryngeal involvement. Communication difficulties, secondary to articulation difficulties and low speech volume, are common. Bulbar dysfunction leads to impaired swallowing. Intellectual disability (ID) / developmental delay (DD) are commonly reported. Additional findings can include eye movement abnormalities, skin changes, psychiatric comorbidities (attention- deficit/hyperactivity disorder, anxiety, depression, and obsessive-compulsive disorder), myoclonus, seizures, spasticity, and sensorineural hearing loss. Many affected individuals follow a similar disease course, though milder and atypical findings have been described. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of DYT-KMT2B is established in a proband with either a heterozygous pathogenic variant in KMT2B or a heterozygous interstitial deletion of 19q13.12 that includes a KMTB2 whole-gene deletion. Management Treatment of manifestations: Dystonia: Although pharmacologic treatment with levodopa and other commonly used anti-dystonic agents generally does not result in long-term benefit for the majority of affected individuals, a trial of these agents is considered reasonable. One group observed a significant improvement of motor manifestations with an antimuscarinic (anticholinergic) agent. Bilateral globus pallidus interna deep brain stimulation results in substantial clinical improvement, particularly in younger individuals.

    "_id": "krabbe",
    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Krabbe disease comprises a spectrum ranging from infantile-onset disease (i.e., onset of extreme irritability, spasticity, and developmental delay before age 12 months) to later-onset disease (i.e., onset of manifestations after age 12 months and as late as the seventh decade). Although historically 85%-90% of symptomatic individuals with Krabbe disease diagnosed by enzyme activity alone have infantile-onset Krabbe disease and 10%-15% have later-onset Krabbe disease, the experience with newborn screening (NBS) suggests that the proportion of individuals with possible later-onset Krabbe disease is higher than previously thought. Infantile- onset Krabbe disease is characterized by normal development in the first few months followed by rapid severe neurologic deterioration; the average age of death is 24 months (range 8 months to 9 years). Later-onset Krabbe disease is much more variable in its presentation and disease course. Diagnosis/testing The two diagnostic scenarios are the following: Scenario 1. The diagnosis of Krabbe disease, suspected in a symptomatic proband based on clinical findings (by age) and other supportive laboratory, neuroimaging, and electrophysiologic findings, is established by detection of deficient GALC enzyme activity in leukocytes. Abnormal results require follow-up molecular genetic testing of GALC; elevated psychosine levels can also help establish the diagnosis. Scenario 2. In an asymptomatic newborn with low GALC enzyme activity on dried blood spot specimens on NBS urgent time-critical measurement of blood psychosine levels and GALC molecular genetic testing is necessary to identify before age 14 days those newborns with evidence of infantile-onset Krabbe disease who are candidates for early treatment with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).

Management GeneReviews Treatment of manifestations: Treatment of a child who is symptomatic before age six months is supportive and focused on increasing the quality of life and avoiding complications. For older individuals, treatment with HSCT is individualized based on disease burden and manifestations. Prevention of primary manifestations: Consensus guidelines recommend that asymptomatic newborns identified by either prenatal/neonatal evaluation because of a positive family history of Krabbe disease or an abnormal NBS result undergo additional testing to identify those with infantile-onset Krabbe disease. Those with laboratory findings consistent with infantile-onset Krabbe disease are candidates for HSCT before age 30 days. Surveillance: Monitor symptomatic individuals with Krabbe disease for development of: hydrocephalus, swallowing difficulties and chronic microaspiration, scoliosis, hip subluxation, and osteopenia, decreased vision, and corneal ulcerations. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Atypical antipsychotics and multiple medications for seizures can cause over- sedation (affecting cognition, respiratory drive, and rate of neurologic decline). Routine childhood vaccinations can accelerate disease progression. Evaluation of relatives at risk: Couples who have had one child with molecularly confirmed infantile-onset Krabbe disease may choose prenatal molecular genetic testing in subsequent pregnancies so that newborns with biallelic GALC pathogenic variants can be promptly tested and if appropriate -- referred for HSCT. Genetic counseling Krabbe disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. At conception, each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier.

KSS is a progressive multisystem disorder with onset before age 20 years characterized by pigmentary retinopathy, CPEO, and cardiac conduction abnormality. Additional features can include cerebellar ataxia, tremor, intellectual disability or cognitive decline, dementia, sensorineural hearing loss, oropharyngeal and esophageal dysfunction, exercise intolerance, muscle weakness, and endocrinopathies. Brain imaging typically shows bilateral lesions in the globus pallidus and white matter. KSS spectrum includes individuals with KSS in addition to individuals with ptosis and/or ophthalmoparesis and at least one of the following: retinopathy, ataxia, cardiac conduction defects, hearing loss, growth deficiency, cognitive impairment, tremor, or cardiomyopathy. Compared to CPEO-plus, individuals with KSS spectrum have more severe muscle involvement (e.g., weakness, atrophy) and overall have a worse prognosis. PS is characterized by pancytopenia (typically transfusion-dependent sideroblastic anemia with variable cell line involvement), exocrine pancreatic dysfunction, poor weight gain, and lactic acidosis. PS manifestations also include renal tubular acidosis, short stature, and elevated liver enzymes. PS may be fatal in infancy due to neutropenia-related infection or refractory metabolic acidosis. CPEO is characterized by ptosis, ophthalmoplegia, oropharyngeal weakness, variable proximal limb weakness, and/or exercise intolerance. CPEO-plus includes CPEO with additional multisystemic involvement including neuropathy, diabetes mellitus, migraines, hypothyroidism, neuropsychiatric manifestations, and optic neuropathy.

Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of an SLSMDS is established in a proband with characteristic clinical features by identification of a mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) deletion ranging in size from 1.1 to 10 kb on molecular genetic testing. SLSMDSs can be identified in DNA from blood, buccal cells, and urine in affected children; analysis of skeletal muscle tissue may be required to detect an SLSMDS in an affected adult. Management Targeted therapy: Folinic acid supplementation in individuals with KSS with low 5-methyltetrahydrofolate in CSF or white matter abnormalities on brain MRI. Supportive care: Consider mitochondrial supplement therapies such as coenzyme Q10 and antioxidants; optimize nutrition and exercise regimen to prevent acute decompensation; physical and occupational therapy for myopathy and/or ataxia; standard treatment with anti-seizure medication; hearing aids or cochlear implants for sensorineural hearing loss; developmental and educational support; feeding therapy; consider gastrostomy tube placement if poor weight gain, choking, or aspiration risk is present; dilation of the upper esophageal sphincter to alleviate cricopharyngeal achalasia; prophylactic placement of cardiac pacemaker in individuals with cardiac conduction block, with consideration of an implantable cardioverter defibrillator; hormone replacement therapy per endocrinologist; electrolyte monitoring and replacement for renal tubular acidosis; eyelid slings and/or ptosis repair for severe ptosis; eye ointment for dry eyes; eyeglass prisms for diplopia; transfusion therapy for individuals with PS with sideroblastic anemia; replacement of pancreatic enzymes for exocrine pancreatic insufficiency; ventilatory support for respiratory abnormalities that may occur in individuals with Leigh syndrome; standard treatment of anxiety and/or depression; social work support and care coordination as needed. Surveillance: Annual neurology assessment for ataxia, neuropathy, seizures, and myopathy; annual audiology evaluation; annual assessment of developmental progress, educational needs, and cognitive issues; annual evaluation by a neuro-ophthalmologist and/or retinal specialist and oculoplastics; measurement of growth parameters and evaluation of nutritional status and safety of oral intake at each visit; annual assessment of mobility and self-help skills with physical medicine, occupational therapy, and/or physical therapy; EKG and echocardiogram every six to 12 months; annual assessment with an endocrinologist; BUN and creatinine, with consideration of cystatin C in those with low muscle mass; complete blood count in those with PS to assess transfusion needs with additional labs per hematologist, and ferritin for those needing recurrent transfusions as needed; annual complete blood count in those with other SLSMDSs; fecal fat and fecal elastase as needed based on symptoms; monitor for evidence of aspiration and respiratory insufficiency at each visit; assess family needs at each visit. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Volatile anesthetic hypersensitivity may occur. Avoid prolonged treatment with propofol (>30-60 minutes). Medications should be reviewed with a physician familiar with mitochondrial disorders including a thorough individualized assessment of risk vs benefit as several medications may be toxic to mitochondria. Genetic counseling SLSMDSs are almost never inherited, suggesting that these disorders are typically caused by a de novo single large-scale mitochondrial DNA deletion (SLSMD) that occurs in the mother's oocytes during germline development or in the embryo during embryogenesis. If the mother is clinically unaffected and the proband Large-Scale Mitochondrial DNA Deletion Syndromes 3 represents a simplex case (i.e., a single affected family member), the empiric risk to the sibs of a proband is very low (at or below 1%). If the mother is affected, the recurrence risk to sibs is estimated to be approximately 4% (one in 24 births). Maternal transmission to more than one child has not been reported to date. Prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are scientifically possible but technically prohibitive as next-generation sequencing methodology does not accurately quantify heteroplasmy level of an SLSMD and droplet digital quantitative PCR cannot reliably detect less than 10% heteroplasmy levels of an SLSMD. Further, prenatal testing is not clinically available due to the inability to accurately interpret the clinical prognosis based on prenatal diagnostic results of an SLSMD."

Autonomic dysfunction can include bladder dysfunction, constipation, postural hypotension, erectile dysfunction, and (less often) impaired sweating. Pyramidal signs are often more prominent in the lower extremities (e.g., spastic weakness, hypertonia, clonus, brisk deep tendon reflexes, and bilateral Babinski signs). Cerebellar signs typically appear at the same time as the pyramidal signs and include gait ataxia, dysdiadochokinesia, intention tremor, dysmetria, and nystagmus. Many individuals have sensory deficits starting in the lower limbs. Pseudobulbar palsy with dysarthria, dysphagia, and forced crying and laughing may appear in the seventh or eighth decade. Although cognitive function is usually preserved or only mildly impaired early in the disease course, dementia and psychiatric manifestations can occur as late manifestations. Affected individuals may survive for decades after onset. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of LMNB1-related ADLD is established in a proband with suggestive clinical and MRI findings and either an LMNB1 duplication or (more rarely) a heterozygous deletion upstream of the LMNB1 promoter identified by molecular genetic testing.

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Progressive myoclonus epilepsy, Lafora type (also known as Lafora disease [LD]) is characterized by focal occipital seizures presenting as transient blindness or visual hallucinations and fragmentary, symmetric, or generalized myoclonus beginning in previously healthy individuals at age eight to 19 years (peak 14-16 years). Generalized tonic-clonic seizures, atypical absence seizures, atonic seizures, and focal seizures with impaired awareness may occur. The course of the disease is characterized by increasing frequency and intractability of seizures. Status epilepticus with any of the seizure types is common. Cognitive decline becomes apparent at or soon after the onset of seizures. Dysarthria and ataxia appear early while spasticity appears late. Emotional disturbance and confusion are common in the early stages of the disease and are followed by dementia. Most affected individuals die within ten years of onset, usually from status epilepticus or from complications related to nervous system degeneration. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of Lafora disease is established in a proband with characteristic neurologic findings and/or biallelic pathogenic variants in one of the two known causative genes, EPM2A or NHLRC1, identified on molecular genetic testing. On rare occasion skin biopsy to detect Lafora bodies is necessary to confirm the diagnosis. Management Treatment of manifestations: Medical treatment in combination with physical therapy and psychosocial support. Regular evaluation and readjustment are required as the disease progresses.

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics The phenotypic spectrum of lysosomal acid lipase (LAL) deficiency ranges from the infantile-onset form (Wolman disease) to later-onset forms collectively known as cholesterol ester storage disease (CESD). Wolman disease is characterized by infantile-onset malabsorption that results in malnutrition, storage of cholesterol esters and triglycerides in hepatic macrophages that results in hepatomegaly and liver disease, and adrenal gland calcification that results in adrenal cortical insufficiency. Unless successfully treated with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), infants with classic Wolman disease do not survive beyond age one year. CESD may present in childhood in a manner similar to Wolman disease or later in life with such findings as serum lipid abnormalities, hepatosplenomegaly, and/or elevated liver enzymes long before a diagnosis is made. The morbidity of late-onset CESD results from atherosclerosis (coronary artery disease, stroke), liver disease (e.g., altered liver function jaundice, steatosis, fibrosis, cirrhosis and related complications of esophageal varices, and/or liver failure), complications of secondary hypersplenism (i.e., anemia and/or thrombocytopenia), and/or malabsorption. Individuals with CESD may have a normal life span depending on the severity of disease manifestations. Diagnosis/testing Diagnosis of LAL deficiency is suspected in individuals with characteristic clinical findings such as hepatomegaly, elevated transaminases, and a typical serum lipid profile: high total serum concentrations of cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, and triglycerides; and low serum concentration of high-density lipoprotein. The diagnosis is confirmed by identification of either biallelic pathogenic variants in LIPA or deficient LAL enzyme activity in peripheral blood leukocytes, fibroblasts, or dried blood spots.

Management Treatment of manifestations: GeneReviews Both Wolman disease and CESD: Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with sebelipase alfa was recently approved by the FDA and is administered at a dose of 1 mg/kg body weight every other week; this treatment can be life saving for those with severe Wolman syndrome and life improving with prolonged survival in those who have CESD. Consider referral to a liver specialist. Liver transplantation may be indicated when liver disease progresses to cirrhosis and liver failure. Wolman disease: Consultation with a nutrition team to limit malnutrition if possible, including use of parenteral nutrition; corticosteroid and mineralocorticoid replacement in the presence of adrenal insufficiency. CESD: Reduce cholesterol through the use of statins, cholestyramine, and a diet low in cholesterol and triglycerides. Aggressive reduction of additional cardiovascular risk factors and lipophilic vitamins may also be beneficial. Consult with a nutrition team for children with failure to thrive or adults with weight loss. Prevention of primary manifestations: Successful hematopoietic stem cell transplantation can correct the metabolic defect. Prevention of secondary complications: Use nonspecific beta-blockers in those with esophageal varices to reduce the risk of bleeding. Surveillance: No standard guidelines for surveillance of CESD have been developed. For children: Monitor growth and nutritional status; evaluate fasting lipid levels, platelet count, and liver enzymes every six months. For adults: reevaluate every 6-12 months depending on disease severity. Monitor nutritional status. Evaluate fasting lipid levels, platelet count, and liver enzymes routinely. Evaluate those with severe liver disease for esophageal varices by upper endoscopy every three years. Monitor and treat those with hepatosplenomegaly thrombocytopenia to prevent bleeding complications. For children and adults: monitor hepatosplenic volume and screen for hepatocellular carcinoma with serial liver and spleen imaging. Agents/circumstances to avoid: In the presence of thrombocytopenia avoid use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Evaluation of relatives at risk: It is appropriate to evaluate the sibs of a proband in order to identify those who would benefit from early treatment and surveillance. Genetic counseling LAL deficiency is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier.

The neurologic dysfunction involves the legs more than the arms. The tendon reflexes are retained. Deterioration of motor skills usually starts in childhood or adolescence, but occasionally not until adulthood. Dysarthria develops over time. Occasional findings include epilepsy; learning problems; cognitive decline; and reduced consciousness, neurologic deterioration, and fever following minor head trauma. Individuals with neonatal or early-infantile onset have a severe disease course often associated with early death. Those with childhood onset have slow progression with wheelchair dependence in the teens or twenties. Adult onset is associated with slow progression and mild impairment. Diagnosis/testing The clinical diagnosis of LBSL can be established in a proband with characteristic abnormalities observed on brain and spinal cord MRI using MRI-based criteria. The molecular diagnosis can be established in a proband with suggestive findings and biallelic pathogenic variants in DARS2 identified by molecular genetic testing. If molecular results are inconclusive, a functional assay to identify reduced MtAspRS enzyme activity in lymphoblasts can confirm the diagnosis.

SEE LEBER CONGENITAL AMAUROSIS / EARLY-ONSET SEVERE RETINAL DYSTROPHY OVERVIEW. Clinical characteristics Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA), a severe dystrophy of the retina, typically becomes evident in the first year of life. Visual function is usually poor and often accompanied by nystagmus, sluggish or near-absent pupillary responses, photophobia, high hyperopia, and keratoconus. Visual acuity is rarely better than 20/400. A characteristic finding is Franceschetti's oculo-digital sign, comprising eye poking, pressing, and rubbing. The appearance of the fundus is extremely variable. While the retina may initially appear normal, a pigmentary retinopathy reminiscent of retinitis pigmentosa is frequently observed later in childhood. The electroretinogram (ERG) is characteristically \\\"nondetectable\\\" or severely subnormal. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of LCA is established by clinical findings. Pathogenic variants in 17 genes are known to cause LCA: GUCY2D (locus name: LCA1), RPE65 (LCA2), SPATA7 (LCA3), AIPL1 (LCA4), LCA5 (LCA5), RPGRIP1 (LCA6), CRX (LCA7), CRB1 (LCA8), NMNAT1 (LCA9), CEP290 (LCA10), IMPDH1 (LCA11), RD3 (LCA12), RDH12 (LCA13), LRAT (LCA14), TULP1 (LCA15), KCNJ13 (LCA16), and IQCB1. Together, pathogenic variants in these genes are estimated to account for more than half of all LCA diagnoses. At least one other disease locus for LCA has been reported, but the gene is not known.

Management GeneReviews Treatment of manifestations: Treatment is supportive. Children and their parents should be referred to programs for the visually impaired child within their state or locality. Affected individuals benefit from correction of refractive error, use of low-vision aids when possible, and optimal access to educational and work-related opportunities. Prevention of secondary complications: When possible children should be discouraged from repeatedly poking and pressing on their eyes. Surveillance: Periodic ophthalmic evaluation for assessment of vision, trials of correction for refractive error, and, in those with residual vision, assessment of the presence of amblyopia, glaucoma, or cataract. Genetic counseling Most often LCA is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. At conception, each sib of an individual with recessively inherited LCA has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Carrier testing for at-risk family members is possible if the pathogenic variants in the family are known. Prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk is possible through laboratories offering either testing for the gene of interest or custom testing. Rarely, LCA is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner as a result of a pathogenic variant in CRX; the possibility of autosomal dominant inheritance resulting from a de novo CRX pathogenic variant should be considered in individuals with LCA and no family history of the disease."

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Lymphedema-distichiasis syndrome (referred to as LDS in this GeneReview) is characterized by lower-limb lymphedema, and distichiasis (aberrant eyelashes ranging from a full set of extra eyelashes to a single hair). Lymphedema typically appears in late childhood or puberty, is confined to the lower limbs with or without involvement of the external genitalia, and is often asymmetric; severity varies within families. Males develop edema at an earlier age and have more problems with cellulitis than females. Distichiasis, which may be present at birth, is observed in 94% of affected individuals. About 75% of affected individuals have ocular findings including corneal irritation, recurrent conjunctivitis, and photophobia; other common findings include varicose veins and ptosis. Diagnosis/testing The clinical diagnosis of LDS is established in a proband with either lymphedema and distichiasis, distichiasis and a family history of lower-limb lymphedema, or lower-limb lymphedema and a family history of distichiasis. If clinical findings are not diagnostic, the identification of a heterozygous FOXC2 pathogenic variant by molecular genetic testing confirms the diagnosis. Management Treatment of manifestations: Lubrication, plucking, cryotherapy, electrolysis, or lid splitting for treatment of distichiasis; fitted compression garments and bandaging to improve swelling and discomfort associated with edema. To prevent secondary cellulitis, good skin care and prompt treatment of infected skin lesions; prompt treatment of cellulitis with antibiotics. The implementation of hosiery prior to the development of lymphedema may help reduce the extent of edema. Diuretics are not effective in the treatment of lymphedema.

Genetic counseling Lenz microphthalmia syndrome is inherited in an X-linked manner. The risk to sibs depends on the carrier status of the mother. If the mother is a carrier, the chance of transmitting the pathogenic variant is 50% in each pregnancy: males who inherit the pathogenic variant will be affected; females who inherit the pathogenic variant will be carriers. The majority of males with Lenz microphthalmia syndrome do not reproduce. Carrier testing for at-risk female relatives and prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk are possible for families in which the pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member. Prenatal ultrasound examination at 18 weeks' gestation can be offered for pregnancies at increased risk to evaluate fetal renal development."

Multiple lentigines present as dispersed flat, black-brown macules, mostly on the face, neck, and upper part of the trunk with sparing of the mucosa. In general, lentigines do not appear until age four to five years but then increase to the thousands by puberty. Some individuals with NSML do not exhibit lentigines. Approximately 85% of affected individuals have heart defects, including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (typically appearing during infancy and sometimes progressive) and pulmonary valve stenosis. Postnatal growth restriction resulting in short stature occurs in fewer than 50% of affected persons, although most affected individuals have a height that is less than the 25th centile for age. Sensorineural hearing deficits, present in approximately 20% of affected individuals, are poorly characterized. Intellectual disability, typically mild, is observed in approximately 30% of persons with NSML.

Clinical findings of calpainopathy include the tendency to walk on tiptoe, difficulty in running, scapular winging, waddling gait, laxity of the abdominal muscles, Achilles tendon shortening, and scoliosis. Affected individuals typically do not have cardiac involvement or intellectual disability. Three autosomal recessive calpainopathy phenotypes have been identified based on the distribution of muscle weakness and age at onset: Pelvifemoral limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) (Leyden-Mbius LGMD) phenotype, the most frequently observed calpainopathy phenotype, in which muscle weakness is first evident in the pelvic girdle and later in the shoulder girdle, with onset that may occur as early as before age 12 years or as late as after age 30 years Scapulohumeral LGMD (Erb LGMD) phenotype, usually a milder phenotype with infrequent early onset, in which muscle weakness is first evident in the shoulder girdle and later in the pelvic girdle HyperCKemia, usually observed in children or young individuals, in which individuals are asymptomatic and have high serum creatine kinase (CK) concentrations The autosomal dominant form of calpainopathy is clinically variable, ranging from almost asymptomatic to wheelchair dependence after age 60 years in a few individuals; phenotype is generally milder than the recessive form. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of calpainopathy is established by identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in CAPN3 or a dominantly acting heterozygous CAPN3 pathogenic variant by molecular genetic testing.

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is a cancer predisposition syndrome associated with high risks for a broad spectrum of cancers including early-onset cancers. Five cancer types account for the majority of LFS tumors: adrenocortical carcinomas, breast cancer, central nervous system tumors, osteosarcomas, and soft-tissue sarcomas. Other cancers associated with LFS include leukemia, colorectal cancer, stomach cancer, lung cancer, melanoma, pediatric head and neck cancers, pancreatic cancer, and prostate cancer. Cancer survivors are at increased risk for developing additional primary cancers and treatment-related secondary cancers. The lifetime risks of cancer for women and men with classic LFS are 90% and 70%, respectively, and 50% of cancers occur prior to age 40 years. Diagnosis/testing The clinical diagnosis of LFS can be established in a proband who meets clinical diagnostic criteria, or the molecular diagnosis is established in a proband with a germline pathogenic variant in TP53 identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Bilateral mastectomy rather than lumpectomy is often recommended for LFS- related breast cancer to reduce the risk of a second primary breast cancer and to avoid radiation therapy. Radiation therapy should be avoided if possible with treatment of other cancers, to reduce the risk of secondary malignancies. Conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy may also pose an increased secondary cancer risk; however, treatment efficacy should be prioritized above concerns about late effects. Otherwise, standard oncologic management is recommended.

Surveillance: Comprehensive physical examination and ultrasound of abdomen and pelvis every three to four months from birth to age 18 years; comprehensive physical examination every six months in those older than age 18 years; annual whole-body MRI; females should have a clinical breast examination every six to 12 months beginning at age 20-25 years, annual breast MRI starting between age 20-30 years, and annual mammogram alternating with breast MRI from age 30 to 75 years; annual brain MRI; upper endoscopy and colonoscopy every two to five years beginning at age 25 years; annual dermatologic exam beginning at age 18 years; annual ultrasound of the abdomen and pelvis beginning at age 18 years; consider additional screening for lung, pancreatic, prostate, and thyroid cancer depending on family history and additional risk factors; assess social work and genetic counseling needs at each visit. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Minimize exposure to diagnostic and therapeutic radiation; avoid known carcinogens including unprotected sun exposure, tobacco use, occupational exposures, and excessive alcohol use. Evaluation of relatives at risk: If a molecular diagnosis of LFS has been established in the proband, offer TP53 molecular genetic testing to all first-degree relatives (including children) and other relatives in order to identify individuals with LFS who would benefit from increased cancer monitoring, with attention to symptoms or signs of cancer and early intervention when a cancer or precancer is identified. If a clinical diagnosis of LFS has been established in the proband but the proband does not have an identified TP53 pathogenic variant, all at-risk family members should be counseled regarding their potential increased risks for LFS-related cancers and options for surveillance and risk reduction. Genetic counseling LFS is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Most individuals diagnosed with LFS inherited a TP53 pathogenic variant from a parent. Some individuals diagnosed with LFS have the disorder as the result of a de novo germline pathogenic variant. The frequency of de novo pathogenic variants is estimated at between 7% and 20%. Each child of an individual with a molecular diagnosis of LFS has a 50% risk of inheriting the TP53 pathogenic variant; each child of an individual with a clinical diagnosis of LFS (in whom a TP53 pathogenic variant has not been identified) is presumed to have an increased risk for LFS. If a TP53 pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, predictive testing for at-risk family members and prenatal/ preimplantation genetic testing are possible."

Extracutaneous manifestations may include epilepsy, neuropsychiatric disorders, spontaneous CNS hemorrhage, and asymptomatic multiple yellowish nodules throughout the gastrointestinal tract. Generally, the disease course is chronic and fluctuating. Males and females are affected equally. Affected individuals have a normal life span unless they experience laryngeal obstruction. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of lipoid proteinosis is established in a proband with characteristic clinical findings and either biallelic ECM1 pathogenic variants identified on molecular genetic testing or characteristic histologic and/or immunolabeling findings on skin biopsy. Management Treatment of manifestations: There is no curative therapy for LP. Microlaryngoscopic excision of laryngeal deposits can improve airway access and voice quality. Significant airway obstruction may require tracheostomy to ensure a safe airway. Oral dimethylsulfoxide, D-penicillamine, and oral retinoid may be used for skin softening and amelioration of mucosal lesions and hoarseness. Seizures should be assessed and managed by a neurologist with anti-seizure medications.

Neurologic sequel of the meningoceles depend on size and location and can include neurogenic bladder, paresthesia, back pain, and/or paraparesis. Other neurologic findings can include Chiari I malformation, syringomyelia, and rarely, hydrocephalus. Additional findings of LMS include developmental delay, mixed or conductive hearing loss, and cleft palate.

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics HPRT1 disorders, caused by deficiency of the enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGprt), are typically associated with clinical evidence for overproduction of uric acid (hyperuricemia, nephrolithiasis, and/or gouty arthritis) and varying degrees of neurologic and/or behavioral problems. Historically, three phenotypes were identified in the spectrum of HPRT1 disorders: Lesch-Nyhan disease (LND) at the most severe end with motor dysfunction resembling severe cerebral palsy, intellectual disability, and self- injurious behavior; HPRT1-related neurologic dysfunction (HND) in the intermediate range with similar but fewer severe neurologic findings than LND and no self-injurious behavior; and HPRT1-related hyperuricemia (HRH) at the mild end without overt neurologic deficits. It is now recognized that these neurobehavioral phenotypes cluster along a continuum from severe to mild. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of an HPRT1 disorder is established in a male proband with suggestive clinical and laboratory findings and a hemizygous pathogenic variant in HPRT1 identified by molecular genetic testing and/or low HGprt enzyme activity identified on biochemical testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Hyperuricemia is most commonly treated with the xanthine oxidase inhibitor allopurinol to reduce the risk for nephropathy, gouty arthritis, and tophi. Febuxostat may be used in case of allopurinol hypersensitivity. Multidisciplinary specialists may be needed to manage the neurologic manifestations. Depending on needs, specialists in medical genetics, neurology, behavioral management, developmental pediatrics, physical medicine and rehabilitation, physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech- language pathology, dentistry, and nephrology may be required.

GeneReviews Surveillance: HPRT1 disorders are not clinically progressive; however, surveillance is important for all HPRT1 disorders. While overproduction of uric acid does not get worse with time, chronic overproduction of uric acid especially if not well controlled may lead to cumulative pathology in the kidneys and/or joints. Similarly, new or worsening neurologic problems are not expected over time; however, some evolution of the neurologic problems occurs in the first few years of life, which reflects development of the nervous system in response to a static insult. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Probenecid and other drugs that increase the risk for precipitation of uric acid in the urinary system and may cause acute renal failure; certain chemotherapy agents, such as methotrexate, that block synthesis or use of purines; periods of relative dehydration because they increase the risk for renal stones or urate nephropathy. Evaluation of relatives at risk: It is appropriate to clarify the status of males at risk for HPRT1 disorders immediately after birth in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from prompt initiation of xanthine oxidase inhibitors and anticipation of future needs. Genetic counseling HPRT1 disorders are X linked. The risk to sibs of a male proband depends on the genetic status of the mother. If the mother of the proband has an HPRT1 variant, the chance of transmitting it in each pregnancy is 50%: males who inherit a pathogenic HPRT1 variant will be affected. Females who inherit the pathogenic variant will be heterozygotes and will virtually always be clinically normal. If the proband represents a simplex case (i.e., a single occurrence in a family) and if the proband has a known HPRT1 variant that cannot be detected in his mothers leukocyte DNA, the risk to sibs is low but greater than that of the general population because of the possibility of maternal mosaicism. Once an HPRT1 pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, heterozygote testing for females and prenatal/preimplantation genetic testing are possible."

Individuals with LDS are predisposed to widespread and aggressive arterial aneurysms and pregnancy-related complications including uterine rupture and death. Individuals with LDS can show a strong predisposition for allergic/inflammatory disease including asthma, eczema, and reactions to food or environmental allergens. There is also an increased incidence of gastrointestinal inflammation including eosinophilic esophagitis and gastritis or inflammatory bowel disease. Wide variation in the distribution and severity of clinical features can be seen in individuals with LDS, even among affected individuals within a family who have the same pathogenic variant. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of LDS is established in (1) a proband with characteristic clinical findings or (2) by the identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in SMAD2, SMAD3, TGFB2, TGFB3, TGFBR1, or TGFBR2 or biallelic pathogenic variants in IPO8 in a proband with aortic root enlargement, type A dissection, other characteristic clinical features of LDS, or a family history of an established diagnosis of LDS. Management Treatment of manifestations: Important considerations when managing cardiovascular features of LDS include the following: aortic dissection can occur at smaller aortic diameters and at younger ages than observed in Marfan syndrome; vascular disease is not limited to the aortic root; angiotensin receptor blockers, beta- adrenergic receptor blockers, or other medications are used to reduce hemodynamic stress; and aneurysms are Author Affiliations: 1 Center of Medical Genetics, Antwerp University Hospital, Antwerp, Belgium; Email: bart.loeys@uantwerp.be. 2 Victor A McKusick Professor of Medicine and Genetics, Department of Genetic Medicine, Departments of Pediatrics, Medicine, and Molecular Biology and Genetics, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland; Email: hdietz@jhmi.edu.

GeneReviews amenable to early and aggressive surgical intervention. Consider subacute bacterial endocarditis prophylaxis in those undergoing dental work or other procedures expected to contaminate the bloodstream with bacteria. Management of orthopedic manifestations per orthopedist. Surgical fixation of cervical spine instability may be necessary to prevent spinal cord damage. Management by a craniofacial team is preferred for treatment of cleft palate and craniosynostosis. Hernias tend to recur after surgical intervention; a supporting mesh can be used during surgical repair to minimize recurrence risk. Standard treatment for allergic complications with consideration of referral to an allergy/immunology specialist in those with severe disease. Careful and aggressive refraction and visual correction is mandatory in young children at risk for amblyopia. Optimal management of pneumothorax to prevent recurrence may require chemical or surgical pleurodesis or surgical removal of pulmonary blebs. Counseling regarding risk and clinical manifestations of organ rupture. Surveillance: Echocardiography to monitor the status of the aortic root and ascending aorta (at least annually) and magnetic resonance angiography or computerized tomography angiography to assess the entire arterial tree (at least every other year); more frequent imaging may be indicated based on genotype, family history, absolute vessel size or growth rate, or vascular pathology. Assess for skeletal deformity, joint manifestations, pes planus, hernia, and allergic and inflammatory manifestations at each visit or as needed. Individuals with cervical spine instability and severe or progressive scoliosis should be followed by an orthopedist. Eye examination per ophthalmologist. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Contact sports, competitive sports, and isometric exercise; agents that stimulate the cardiovascular system including routine use of decongestants or triptan medications for the management of migraine headache; activities that cause joint injury or pain; for individuals at risk for recurrent pneumothorax, breathing against a resistance (e.g., playing a brass instrument) or positive pressure ventilation (e.g., scuba diving). Evaluation of relatives at risk: Clarify the genetic status of at-risk relatives of any age either by molecular genetic testing (if the LDS-related pathogenic variant[s] in the family are known) or by clinical examination including echocardiography and extensive vascular imaging if findings suggest LDS or if findings were subtle in the index case (if the pathogenic variant[s] in the family are not known) so that affected individuals can undergo regular cardiovascular screening to detect aortic aneurysms and initiate appropriate medical or surgical intervention. Pregnancy management: Pregnancy and the postpartum period can be dangerous for women with LDS because of increased risk of aortic dissection/rupture and uterine rupture. Increased frequency of aortic imaging is recommended, both during pregnancy and in the weeks following delivery. Genetic counseling LDS caused by a pathogenic variant in SMAD2, SMAD3, TGFB2, TGFB3, TGFBR1, or TGFBR2 is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. IPO8-related LDS is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Autosomal dominant inheritance: Approximately 75% of probands diagnosed with LDS have the disorder as the result of a de novo pathogenic variant; approximately 25% of individuals diagnosed with LDS have an affected parent. Each child of an individual with LDS has a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant and the disorder. Autosomal recessive inheritance: The parents of a child with IPO8-related LDS are presumed to be heterozygous for an IPO8 pathogenic variant. If both parents are known to be heterozygous for an IPO8 pathogenic variant, each sib of an affected individual has at conception a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Carrier testing for at-risk relatives requires prior identification of the IPO8 pathogenic variants in the family.

Dense congenital cataracts are found in all affected boys and infantile glaucoma in approximately 50%. All boys have impaired vision; corrected acuity is rarely better than 20/100. Generalized hypotonia is noted at birth and is of central (brain) origin. Deep tendon reflexes are usually absent. Hypotonia may slowly improve with age, but normal motor tone and strength are never achieved. Motor milestones are delayed. Almost all affected males have some degree of intellectual disability; 10%-25% function in the low- normal or borderline range, approximately 25% in the mild-to-moderate range, and 50%-65% in the severe-to- profound range of intellectual disability. Affected males have varying degrees of proximal renal tubular dysfunction of the Fanconi type, including low molecular-weight (LMW) proteinuria, aminoaciduria, bicarbonate wasting and renal tubular acidosis, phosphaturia with hypophosphatemia and renal rickets, hypercalciuria, sodium and potassium wasting, and polyuria. The features of symptomatic Fanconi syndrome do not usually become manifest until after the first few months of life, except for LMW proteinuria. Glomerulosclerosis associated with chronic tubular injury usually results in slowly progressive chronic renal failure and end-stage renal disease between the second and fourth decades of life. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of Lowe syndrome is established in a male proband with typical clinical and laboratory findings and a hemizygous pathogenic variant in OCRL identified by molecular genetic testing. The diagnosis of Lowe syndrome is rare in females but can be established in a female proband who demonstrates the same clinical and laboratory findings as a male proband and who is found to have a heterozygous pathogenic variant in OCRL by molecular genetic testing.

Management Treatment of manifestations: GeneReviews Early removal of cataracts with postoperative glasses; management of glaucoma; early infant therapy, preschool intervention program and individualized education program throughout schooling; behavior modification plan; anticonvulsant therapy if seizures are present. Treatment of renal tubular dysfunction includes oral supplements of sodium and potassium bicarbonate or citrate to correct acidosis and hypokalemia, and oral phosphate and oral calcitriol (1,25- dihydroxyvitamin D3) to correct hypophosphatemia and renal rickets; treatment of ESRD with chronic dialysis and renal transplant in selected individuals. Consider human growth hormone therapy to improve growth velocity; tube feedings may be needed to treat infant feeding problems associated with hypotonia; standard treatment for gastroesophageal reflux if present. Bracing or surgery for severe or progressive scoliosis or joint hypermobility; resection of fibromas and cutaneous cysts if painful or impairing function. Surveillance: Intraocular pressure monitoring every six months for life, other eye evaluations at intervals determined by specialist; at least annual assessment of kidney function, growth, developmental progress; annual evaluation for scoliosis and joint problems; semiannual dental examinations. Circumstances to avoid: Corneal contact lenses because of associated risk of corneal keloid formation and complexities of contact lens care; artificial lens implants because of probable increased risk of glaucoma. Genetic counseling Lowe syndrome is inherited in an X-linked manner. De novo pathogenic variants have been reported in 32% of males affected with Lowe syndrome. A high risk of germline mosaicism (4.5%) has been identified. When a mother is a heterozygous, each pregnancy has a 25% chance of an affected son, a 25% chance of a heterozygous daughter, a 25% chance of an unaffected son, and a 25% chance of a daughter who is not heterozygous. No affected male is known to have reproduced. Approximately 95% of heterozygous females older than age 15 years have characteristic findings in the lens of the eye on slit lamp examination by an experienced ophthalmologist using both direct and retroillumination. Once the OCRL pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing are possible."

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Individuals with LPIN2-related Majeed syndrome typically experience multisystem inflammatory symptoms, including chronic sterile multifocal osteomyelitis, recurrent bone pain, recurrent fever, failure to thrive, dyserythropoietic anemia, and neutrophilic dermatosis. Recurrent bone pain is frequently localized near the joints, often of the long bones of the lower extremities. Recurrent osteomyelitis with joint swelling can lead to subsequent joint contractures. Congenital dyserythropoietic, microcytic anemia can range from mild to severe and sometimes requires blood transfusion. Neutrophilic dermatosis typically presents as transient painful erythematous plaques, pustules, or nodules with neutrophilic infiltrates. Other features of LPIN2-related Majeed syndrome include the development of hepatosplenomegaly and gastrointestinal symptoms, such as recurrent abdominal pain and/or recurrent diarrhea. As more families are being described, individuals with milder features are now being recognized. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of LPIN2-related Majeed syndrome is established in a proband with suggestive findings and biallelic pathogenic variants in LPIN2 identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Anti-inflammatory treatment decreases inflammation and reduces flare-ups. Anti- inflammatory drugs can include anti-interleukin-1 (anti-IL-1) therapy (anakinra 1.5 mg/kg/day with titration as needed or canakinumab 2 mg/kg every 4 or 8 weeks), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroids, or methotrexate. While one of the anti-IL-1 therapies is the drug of choice, these drugs may not be universally available. Severe anemia may require blood transfusion. Physical therapy and/or occupational therapy can help motor delays and joint contractures.

Certain nonmotor symptoms in LRRK2-PD, especially REM sleep behavior disorder and cognitive decline, may occur at similar or slightly reduced frequency compared to typical idiopathic* PD. Onset is generally after age 50, although early-onset (in the 20s) and late-onset (in the 90s) disease has been described. * Idiopathic PD refers to the presence of signs and symptoms of PD for which the etiology is currently unknown and in which there is no known family history of PD. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of LRRK2-PD relies on clinical findings and the identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in LRRK2. Management Treatment of manifestations: Symptomatic treatment of parkinsonism is the same as for idiopathic Parkinson disease: pharmacologic replacement of dopamine, most commonly accomplished with the precursor of dopamine, L-dopa, combined with carbi-dopa. Dopamine agonists may also be used, as well as monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B) inhibitors, amantadine, and/or anticholinergics. Physical, occupational, and voice therapy may be beneficial. Exercise is often recommended.

Other manifestations can include pyloric stenosis, diaphragmatic hernia, rectal prolapse, gastrointestinal elongation/tortuosity, cardiovascular abnormality, pulmonary hypertension, hypotonia and frequent pulmonary infections. Bladder diverticula and hydronephrosis are common. Early demise has been associated with pulmonary emphysema. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of LTBP4-related cutis laxa is established in a proband with cutis laxa and biallelic pathogenic variants in LTBP4. Management Treatment of manifestations: Treatment is largely symptomatic and may include: treatment of pulmonary emphysema (inhaled corticosteroids, atropine, and selective 2-adrenergic bronchodilation, and supplemental oxygen as needed) medical or surgical treatment for gastrointestinal issues; education on complete bladder emptying when voiding; and treatment of clinically relevant pulmonary artery stenosis and pulmonary hypertension; physical therapy for muscle strength and stability. Routine immunizations against respiratory infections is important.

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics The phenotypic spectrum of SHOX deficiency disorders, caused by haploinsufficiency of the short stature homeobox-containing gene (SHOX), ranges from Leri-Weill dyschondrosteosis (LWD) at the severe end of the spectrum to nonspecific short stature at the mild end of the spectrum. In adults with SHOX deficiency, the proportion of LWD versus short stature without features of LWD is not well defined. In LWD the classic clinical triad is short stature, mesomelia, and Madelung deformity. Mesomelia, in which the middle portion of a limb is shortened in relation to the proximal portion, can be evident first in school-aged children and increases with age in frequency and severity. Madelung deformity (abnormal alignment of the radius, ulna, and carpal bones at the wrist) typically develops in mid-to-late childhood and is more common and severe in females. The phenotype of short stature caused by SHOX deficiency in the absence of mesomelia and Madelung deformity (called SHOX- deficient short stature in this GeneReview) is highly variable, even within the same family. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of SHOX deficiency is established in a proband with either a pathogenic SHOX variant or a deletion, duplication, or insertion that can encompass the SHOX coding region and/or the enhancer region regulating SHOX expression. Management Treatment of manifestations: For prepubertal children with SHOX-deficient short stature, recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH therapy) (dose 50 g/kg body weight/day) should be offered. The therapeutic effect is a gain in final height of 7 to 10 cm. For individuals with LWD and painful bilateral Madelung deformity (which is uncommon): wrist splints and supports during periods of increased discomfort and the use of ergonomic devices such as ergonomic computer keyboards. Different operative procedures have been attempted to decrease pain and restore wrist function.

GeneReviews Surveillance: For children with a SHOX deficiency disorder: biannual measurement of growth. Agents/circumstances to avoid: If Madelung deformity is associated with discomfort, physical activities such as lifting, gripping, writing, typing, and sports that strain the wrist should be limited and ergonomic aids sought. Evaluation of relatives at risk: Presymptomatic diagnosis and treatment are warranted for sibs at risk for SHOX- deficient short stature in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) treatment. Genetic counseling SHOX deficiency disorders are inherited in a pseudoautosomal dominant manner. In pseudoautosomal dominant inheritance, homologous genes located on the short arm of the X chromosome (Xp) and the short arm of the Y chromosome (Yp) follow the rules of autosomal inheritance; thus, a SHOX pathogenic variant responsible for SHOX deficiency can be located on either the X or the Y chromosome of an affected male, or on either of the X chromosomes of an affected female. Each child of an individual with a SHOX deficiency disorder has a 50% chance of inheriting the SHOX pathogenic variant. If both parents have SHOX deficiency, the offspring have a 50% chance of having a SHOX deficiency disorder, a 25% chance of having Langer type of mesomelic dwarfism, and a 25% chance of having neither condition. If the SHOX pathogenic variant has been identified in one or both parents, prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk is possible; however, the phenotype of the SHOX deficiency disorder cannot be accurately predicted on the basis of prenatal molecular genetic testing results."

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Initial symptoms of multiple sulfatase deficiency (MSD) can develop from infancy through early childhood, and presentation is widely variable. Some individuals display the multisystemic features characteristic of mucopolysaccharidosis disorders (e.g., developmental regression, organomegaly, skeletal deformities) while other individuals present primarily with neurologic regression (associated with leukodystrophy). Based on age of onset, rate of progression, and disease severity, several different clinical subtypes of MSD have been described: Neonatal MSD is the most severe with presentation in the prenatal period or at birth with rapid progression and death occurring within the first two years of life. Infantile MSD is the most common variant and may be characterized as attenuated (slower clinical course with cognitive disability and neurodegeneration identified in the 2nd year of life) or severe (loss of the majority of developmental milestones by age 5 years). Juvenile MSD is the rarest subtype with later onset of symptoms and subacute clinical presentation. Many of the features found in MSD are progressive, including neurologic deterioration, heart disease, hearing loss, and airway compromise. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of multiple sulfatase deficiency is established in a proband with low activity levels in at least two sulfatase enzymes and/or biallelic pathogenic variants in SUMF1 identified by molecular genetic testing.

Clinical characteristics Majeed syndrome is characterized by: Chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO) that is of early onset with a lifelong course; and Congenital dyserythropoietic anemia (CDA) that presents as hypochromic, microcytic anemia during the first year of life and ranges from mild to transfusion dependent. Some individuals also develop a transient inflammatory dermatosis, often manifesting as Sweet syndrome (neutrophilic skin infiltration). Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis is based on clinical findings and molecular genetic testing of LPIN2, the only gene in which pathogenic variants are known to cause Majeed syndrome. Management Treatment of manifestations: CRMO is treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and physical therapy to avoid disuse atrophy of muscles and contractures. If CRMO does not respond to NSAIDs, corticosteroids can be used short term to control CRMO and skin manifestations; however, the complications of long-term use of corticosteroids limit their use in children. Two affected children had resolution of their bone inflammation when treated with an IL-1 inhibitor. Physical therapy should be employed to avoid disuse atrophy of muscles or contractures.

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics MUTYH polyposis (also referred to as MUTYH-associated polyposis, or MAP) is characterized by a greatly increased lifetime risk of colorectal cancer (CRC). Although typically associated with ten to a few hundred colonic adenomatous polyps, CRC develops in some individuals in the absence of polyposis. Serrated adenomas, hyperplastic/sessile serrated polyps, and mixed (hyperplastic and adenomatous) polyps can also occur. Duodenal adenomas are common, with an increased risk of duodenal cancer. The risk for malignancies of the ovary and bladder is also increased, and there is some evidence of an increased risk for breast and endometrial cancer. Additional reported features include thyroid nodules, benign adrenal lesions, jawbone cysts, and congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis is established in a proband by identification of biallelic germline pathogenic variants in MUTYH on molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Suspicious polyps identified on colonoscopy should be removed until polypectomy alone cannot manage the large size and density of the polyps, at which point either subtotal colectomy or proctocolectomy is performed. Duodenal polyps showing dysplasia or villous changes should be excised during endoscopy. Abnormal findings on thyroid ultrasound examination should be evaluated by a thyroid specialist to determine what combination of monitoring, surgery, and/or fine needle aspiration is appropriate.

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics FBN1-related Marfan syndrome (Marfan syndrome), a systemic disorder of connective tissue with a high degree of clinical variability, comprises a broad phenotypic continuum ranging from mild (features of Marfan syndrome in one or a few systems) to severe and rapidly progressive neonatal multiorgan disease. Cardinal manifestations involve the ocular, skeletal, and cardiovascular systems. Ocular findings include myopia (>50% of affected individuals); ectopia lentis (seen in approximately 60% of affected individuals); and an increased risk for retinal detachment, glaucoma, and early cataracts. Skeletal system manifestations include bone overgrowth and joint laxity; disproportionately long extremities for the size of the trunk (dolichostenomelia); overgrowth of the ribs that can push the sternum in (pectus excavatum) or out (pectus carinatum); and scoliosis that ranges from mild to severe and progressive. The major morbidity and early mortality in Marfan syndrome relate to the cardiovascular system and include dilatation of the aorta at the level of the sinuses of Valsalva (predisposing to aortic tear and rupture), mitral valve prolapse with or without regurgitation, tricuspid valve prolapse, and enlargement of the proximal pulmonary artery. Severe and prolonged regurgitation of the mitral and/or aortic valve can predispose to left ventricular dysfunction and occasionally heart failure. With proper management, the life expectancy of someone with Marfan syndrome approximates that of the general population. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of Marfan syndrome is established in a proband (by definition a person without a known family history of Marfan syndrome) who has an FBN1 pathogenic variant known to be associated with Marfan syndrome and EITHER of the following: Aortic root enlargement (z score 2.0) Ectopia lentis Author Affiliation: 1 Victor A McKusick Professor, Departments of Genetic Medicine, Pediatrics, Medicine, and Molecular Biology & Genetics;, Investigator, Howard Hughes Medical Institute; Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland; Email: hdietz@jhmi.edu. Copyright 1993-2024, University of Washington, Seattle. GeneReviews is a registered trademark of the University of Washington, Seattle. All rights reserved. Management GeneReviews Treatment of manifestations: Comprehensive management by a multidisciplinary team including a clinical geneticist, cardiologist, ophthalmologist, orthopedist, and cardiothoracic surgeon is strongly recommended. Treatment typically includes spectacle correction for refractive errors and, sometimes, surgical removal of a dislocated lens with artificial lens implantation (preferably after growth is complete). Glaucoma, cataracts, and retinal detachment are treated in the standard fashion per an ophthalmologist. Scoliosis may require bracing or surgical stabilization; repair of pectus deformity is largely cosmetic. Functional deficits or pain associated with protusio acetabulae may respond to physical therapy, analgesics, or anti-inflammatory medications. Orthotics and arch supports can lessen leg fatigue, joint pain, and muscle cramps associated with pes planus. Dental crowding may be addressed through orthodontia and a palatal expander may be considered in some cases. Surgical repair of the aorta is indicated either when the maximal measurement of the aortic root approaches 5.0 cm in adults or older children, when the rate of increase of the aortic root diameter approaches 0.5-1.0 cm per year, or if there is progressive and severe aortic regurgitation. For younger children, aortic root surgery should be considered once: (1) the rate of increase of the aortic root diameter approaches 0.5-1.0 cm per year, or (2) there is progressive and severe aortic regurgitation. Severe and progressive mitral valve regurgitation with attendant ventricular dysfunction requires immediate attention of a cardiologist or cardiothoracic surgeon and is the leading indication for cardiovascular surgery in children with Marfan syndrome. Afterload-reducing agents can improve cardiovascular function when congestive heart failure is present. Standard treatment for hernias and pneumothorax is recommended. There are no known effective therapies for symptomatic dural ectasia. Prevention of primary manifestations: Medications that reduce hemodynamic stress on the aortic wall, such as beta-blockers or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), are routinely prescribed. This therapy should be managed by a cardiologist or clinical geneticist familiar with its use. Therapy is generally initiated at the time of diagnosis with Marfan syndrome at any age or upon appreciation of progressive aortic root dilatation even in the absence of a definitive diagnosis. Surveillance: Measurement of length/height/weight at each visit. Ophthalmologic examination annually or as clinically indicated. Clinical assessment for chest wall deformities and scoliosis at each visit until skeletal maturity, although severe scoliosis may require ongoing surveillance in adulthood. At least annual dental evaluation, including orthodontia, as indicated. Echocardiography annually when aortic dimensions are small and the rate of aortic dilatation is slow; more frequent than annual examinations are indicated when the aortic root diameter exceeds approximately 4.5 cm in adults, rates of aortic dilatation exceed approximately 0.3 cm per year, or significant aortic regurgitation is present. Intermittent surveillance of the entire aorta with CT or MRA scans beginning in young adulthood or at least annually in anyone with a history of aortic root replacement or dissection. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Contact sports, competitive sports, and isometric exercise; activities that cause joint injury or pain; agents that stimulate the cardiovascular system, including decongestants and excessive caffeine; agents that cause vasoconstriction, including triptans; LASIK correction of refractive errors; breathing against resistance or positive pressure ventilation in those with a documented predisposition for pneumothorax; fluoroquinolone antibiotics, which may exacerbate the predisposition for aneurysm and dissection; classes of antihypertensive agents (e.g., calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors) where there is an absence of direct evidence for their efficacy or safety in individuals with Marfan syndrome. Evaluation of relatives at risk: It is recommended that the genetic status of at-risk relatives of any age be clarified so that affected individuals can undergo routine surveillance for early detection of medically significant complications, particularly potentially life-threatening cardiac manifestations. Genetic status of at-risk relatives can be established EITHER: By molecular genetic testing if the FBN1 pathogenic variant in the family is known; OR Marfan Syndrome 3 In those with a rigorously defined family history of Marfan syndrome, by the presence of ONE OR MORE of the following: Ectopia lentis A systemic score 7 Aortic root dilatation (z score 2.0 for individuals age 20 years or z score 3.0 for those age <20 years) Pregnancy management: An individual with Marfan syndrome should consider pregnancy only after appropriate counseling from a clinical geneticist or cardiologist familiar with this condition, a genetic counselor, and a high- risk obstetrician because of the risk of more rapid dilation of the aorta or aortic dissection during pregnancy, delivery, or in the immediate postpartum period. Cardiovascular imaging with echocardiography should be performed every two to three months during pregnancy to monitor aortic root size and growth. Monitoring should continue in the immediate postpartum period because of the increased risk for aortic dissection. Individuals with Marfan syndrome who anticipate pregnancy or become pregnant should continue use of beta- blockers; however, some other classes of medications such as ARBs should be discontinued because of the increased risk for fetal loss, oligohydramnios, and abnormal development, often related to second- and third- trimester exposure. Genetic counseling Marfan syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Approximately 75% of individuals with Marfan syndrome have an affected parent; approximately 25% have a de novo FBN1 pathogenic variant. Each child of an individual with Marfan syndrome has a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant and the disorder. Once the FBN1 pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible."

Most children lack speech entirely or have single words, short phrases, or short sentences. Seizures are present in more than 80% of children; onset is usually around age two years. Sleep disturbances, present in about 90%, can result in excessive daytime drowsiness. Abnormal behaviors can include autistic-like behaviors (80%) and self-injury and aggression (>60%).

Individuals with early-onset MoCD typically present in the first days of life with severe encephalopathy, including refractory seizures, opisthotonos, axial and appendicular hypotonia, feeding difficulties, and apnea. Head imaging may demonstrate loss of gray and white matter differentiation, gyral swelling, sulci injury (typically assessed by evaluating the depth of focal lesional injury within the sulci), diffusely elevated T2-weighted signal, and panlobar diffusion restriction throughout the forebrain and midbrain with relative sparring of the brain stem. Prognosis for early-onset MoCD is poor, with about 75% succumbing in infancy to secondary complications of their neurologic disability (i.e., pneumonia). Late-onset MoCD is typically characterized by milder symptoms, such as acute neurologic decompensation in the setting of infection. Episodes vary in nature but commonly consist of altered mental status, dystonia, choreoathetosis, ataxia, nystagmus, and fluctuating hypotonia and hypertonia. These features may improve after resolution of the inciting infection or progress in a gradual or stochastic manner over the lifetime. Brain imaging may be normal or may demonstrate T2-weighted hyperintense or cystic lesions in the globus pallidus, thinning of the corpus callosum, and cerebellar atrophy. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of molybdenum cofactor deficiency is established by identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in GPHN, MOCS1, MOCS2, or MOCS3, or when unavailable, of significantly reduced activity of the enzyme sulfite oxidase in cultured fibroblasts. However, due to low expression of sulfite oxidase in fibroblasts, differentiation between total and partial loss of enzyme activity is difficult to discern.

GeneReviews Management Targeted therapies: In those with MOCS1-related MoCD (MoCD type A), fosdenopterin (NULIBRY) daily infusion through an indwelling catheter (dose based on weight and age; each vial contains 9.5 mg) may be considered, but must be initiated in a very short window after symptom manifestation to achieve maximum benefit. Affected individuals (all subtypes) are often placed on a cysteine-restricted diet, which typically includes low protein intake with restriction of whole natural protein. Supportive care: Feeding therapy and consideration of gastrostomy tube placement in those with concerns about aspiration and/or persistent feeding issues. Thiamine supplementation (1.2 mg/day for infants; 50 mg/1x/day to 100 mg/2x/day for children/adolescents) for those with thiamine deficiency. Magnesium supplementation and standardized migraine prophylactics for those with headaches. Standard treatment for seizures, developmental delay / intellectual disability, spasticity/dystonia, and ectopia lentis. Surveillance: Routine measurement of essential amino acids in those on a low-cysteine low-protein diet. Assessment for new or progressive neurologic manifestations, measurement of growth parameters and head circumference, monitoring of developmental milestones, and assessment of mobility and self-help skills at each visit. At least annual ophthalmology evaluations. Neuropsychological testing and standardized quality-of-life assessments as clinically indicated. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Valproate should be avoided if possible, as sulfite intoxication impairs mitochondrial function in vitro. For individuals on fosdenopterin (NULIBRY), direct sunlight and artificial UV light exposure (i.e., UVA or UVB phototherapy) should be avoided. Evaluation of relatives at risk: For at-risk newborn sibs in whom prenatal testing was not performed, metabolic treatment should be initiated immediately and continued until such a time as the diagnosis has been excluded through molecular genetic testing or by measurement of serum uric acid and urinary: sulfite, s-sulfocysteine, xanthine, hypoxanthine, and uric acid.

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Individuals with medium-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase (MCAD) deficiency typically appear normal at birth, and many are diagnosed through newborn screening programs. Symptomatic individuals experience hypoketotic hypoglycemia in response to either prolonged fasting (e.g., weaning the infant from nighttime feedings) or during intercurrent and common infections (e.g., viral gastrointestinal or upper respiratory tract infections), which typically cause loss of appetite and increased energy requirements when fever is present. Untreated severe hypoglycemic episodes can be accompanied by seizures, vomiting, lethargy, coma, and death. Metabolic decompensation during these episodes can result in elevated liver transaminases and hyperammonemia. Individuals with MCAD deficiency who have experienced the effects of uncontrolled metabolic decompensation are also at risk for chronic myopathy. Early identification and avoidance of prolonged fasting can ameliorate these findings. However, children with MCAD deficiency are at risk for obesity after initiation of treatment due to the frequency of feeding. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of MCAD deficiency is established in a proband through biochemical testing (prominent accumulation of C8-acylcarnitine (octanoylcarnitine) with lesser elevations of C6-, C10-, and C10:1- acylcarnitines and elevated C8/C2 and C8/C10 ratios) AND/OR by identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in ACADM by molecular genetic testing OR by significantly reduced activity of MCAD activity in blood or cultured skin fibroblasts. Because of its relatively high sensitivity, ACADM molecular genetic testing can obviate the need for enzymatic testing, which is available only in limited academic centers.

Management GeneReviews Treatment of manifestations: For routine daily treatment, fasting should be avoided and may require frequent feeding (every 2-3 hours) in infancy, overnight feeding, a bedtime snack, or 2 g/kg of uncooked cornstarch to maintain blood glucose levels during sleep. A normal, healthy diet containing no more than 30% of total energy from fat is recommended. All individuals with MCAD deficiency should avoid skipping meals and weight loss diets that recommend fasting. Prolonged or intense exercise should be covered by adequate carbohydrate intake and hydration. Intravenous glucose is recommended for surgical procedures that require several hours of fasting. Weight control measures such as regular education about proper nutrition and recommended physical exercise should be discussed to help avoid obesity. Standard treatment for developmental delay / aphasia, attention- deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and muscle weakness. For acute inpatient treatment, IV administration of glucose should be initiated immediately with 10% dextrose with appropriate electrolytes at a rate of 1.5 times maintenance rate or at 10-12 mg glucose/kg/minute to achieve and maintain a blood glucose level higher than 5 mmol/L, or between 120 and 170 mg/dL. Address electrolyte and pH imbalances with intravenous fluid management and initiate appropriate treatment for what triggered the metabolic stress. Surveillance: Infants should establish care with a biochemical genetics clinic including a metabolic dietitian as soon as possible following a positive newborn screen. A metabolic dietician should be involved to ensure proper nutrition in terms of quality and quantity. Affected infants should be seen in team clinic in two to three months, then every six to 12 months if otherwise clinically well; however, the frequency of routine follow-up visits is individualized based on comfort level of the affected persons, their families, and health care providers. Routine assessments for growth, acquisition of developmental milestones, neurobehavioral issues, and secondary carnitine deficiency are recommended. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Hypoglycemia; infant formulas, coconut oil, and other manufactured foods containing medium-chain triglycerides as the primary source of fat; popular high-fat/low-carbohydrate diets; alcohol consumption, in particular acute alcohol intoxication (e.g., binge drinking), which can elicit metabolic decompensation; aspirin. Pregnancy management: Pregnant women who have MCAD deficiency must avoid catabolism. This is supported by several case reports describing carnitine deficiency, acute liver failure, and HELLP syndrome (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets) in pregnant women with MCAD deficiency. Genetic counseling MCAD deficiency is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. At conception, the sibs of an affected individual are at a 25% risk of being affected, a 50% risk of being asymptomatic carriers, and a 25% risk of being unaffected and not carriers. Because of the high carrier frequency for the ACADM c.985A>G pathogenic variant in individuals of northern European origin, carrier testing should be discussed with reproductive partners of individuals with MCAD deficiency. Once both ACADM pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member, prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing for MCAD deficiency are possible."

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Fibrous dysplasia / McCune-Albright syndrome (FD/MAS), the result of an early embryonic postzygotic somatic activating pathogenic variant in GNAS (encoding the cAMP pathway-associated G protein Gs [Gs alpha subunit]), is characterized by involvement of the skin, skeleton, and certain endocrine organs. However, because Gs signaling is ubiquitous, additional tissues may be affected. Hyperpigmented skin macules are common and are usually the first manifestation of the disease, apparent at or shortly after birth. Fibrous dysplasia (FD), which can involve any part and combination of the craniofacial, axial, and/or appendicular skeleton, can range from an isolated, asymptomatic monostotic lesion discovered incidentally to severe, disabling polyostotic disease involving practically the entire skeleton and leading to progressive scoliosis, facial deformity, and loss of mobility, vision, and/or hearing. Endocrinopathies include gonadotropin-independent precocious puberty resulting from recurrent ovarian cysts in girls and autonomous testosterone production in boys; testicular lesions with or without associated gonadotropin-independent precocious puberty; thyroid lesions with or without non-autoimmune hyperthyroidism; growth hormone excess; FGF23-mediated phosphate wasting with or without hypophosphatemia in association with fibrous dysplasia; and neonatal hypercortisolism.

Diagnosis/testing GeneReviews In most individuals, the diagnosis of FD/MAS is based on the finding of two or more typical clinical features. In individuals whose only clinical finding is monostotic FD, identification of a somatic activating pathogenic variant in GNAS by molecular genetic testing is required to establish the diagnosis. Variant detection depends on the level of mosaicism in the tissue and the sensitivity of the test method. Management Treatment of manifestations: Management is most effectively accomplished by a multidisciplinary team of specialists. FD: management focuses on optimizing function and minimizing morbidity related to fractures and deformity (including scoliosis). Precocious puberty: treatment prevents bone age advancement and compromise of adult height. For girls, the aromatase inhibitor letrozole is used; for boys, treatment options are less well established. Thyroid disease: methimazole effectively manages hyperthyroidism; however, because hyperthyroidism is persistent, thyroidectomy is common. Growth hormone excess: medical therapy is the preferred first-line treatment; options include (alone or in combination) octreotide and the growth hormone receptor antagonist pegvisomant. Hypercortisolism: treatment varies by the presentation of neonatal Cushing syndrome. Surveillance: FD/MAS: in infants, monitor for clinical signs of hypercortisolism; in all children, monitor for growth acceleration and other clinical signs of precocious puberty and/or growth hormone excess; in children age <5 years, monitor for thyroid function abnormalities; in those with thyroid abnormalities on ultrasound examination but normal thyroid function, perform periodic monitoring of thyroid function; in males, monitor for testicular lesions (physical examination and testicular ultrasound); in individuals on pegvisomant, monitor for hepatotoxicityl in those on homatostatin analogs, monitor for signs and symptoms of gallbladder disease; in females, monitor for breast cancer (earlier than is recommended for the general population). FD: periodic radiographs to monitor existing FD and development of new lesions; periodic serum phosphorus (for development of hypophosphatemia) and 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels. Craniofacial FD: yearly vision and hearing evaluations; periodic skull CT; routine serum IGF-1 levels through young adulthood. Spine FD: close monitoring for progressive scoliosis. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Contact sports and other high-risk activities (when skeletal involvement is significant); prophylactic optic nerve decompression (in individuals with craniofacial FD); surgical removal of ovarian cysts; radiation therapy for treatment of FD; risk factors for malignancy (e.g., radiation exposure). Genetic counseling FD/MAS is not inherited. No parent of a child with FD/MAS has been demonstrated to have any significant, distinctive manifestations of the disorder. The risk to sibs is expected to be the same as in the general population. There are no verified instances of vertical transmission of FD/MAS."

The rate of loss of kidney function for individuals is variable within and between families, with a median age of onset of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) of 46 years (range: ages 20-70 years). There are no other systemic manifestations. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of ADTKD-MUC1 is established in a proband with suggestive clinical findings and molecular genetic testing that reveals a heterozygous pathogenic variant in MUC1 that results in the creation of a specific frameshift protein (MUC1fs) responsible for the pathogenic changes in this disorder. Management Treatment of manifestations: Treatment follows standard guidelines for chronic kidney disease based on the level of the serum creatinine and the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and its sequelae, which can include hypertension, anemia, and gout.

Surveillance: Measurement of hemoglobin, serum concentrations of uric acid and creatinine and blood pressure annually prior to entering CKD Stage 3. Thereafter, follow up is determined by the treating nephrologist. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Affected individuals should follow general recommendations for chronic kidney disease. Pregnancy management: The use of ACE inhibitors should be avoided during pregnancy, as they can result in fetal damage and death. Women who are pregnant, planning a pregnancy, or not actively avoiding pregnancy should be transitioned to another antihypertensive medication. Allopurinol therapy should be stopped during pregnancy, if possible. Evaluation of relatives at risk: For early diagnosis and treatment: It is appropriate to identify as early as possible apparently asymptomatic at-risk adult relatives who have the familial MUC1 variant in order to monitor their serum creatinine levels and promptly initiate treatment and awareness of agents/circumstances to avoid. For kidney donation: Any relative who is a potential kidney donor should undergo molecular genetic testing to clarify the relative's genetic status so that only those who do not have the familial MUC1 pathogenic variant are evaluated further. Genetic counseling ADTKD-MUC1 is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Each child of an affected individual has a 50% chance of inheriting the MUC1 pathogenic variant. Prenatal testing for MUC1 pathogenic variants is not available in the US at this time."

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics McLeod neuroacanthocytosis syndrome (designated as MLS throughout this review) is a multisystem disorder with central nervous system (CNS), neuromuscular, cardiovascular, and hematologic manifestations in males: CNS manifestations are a neurodegenerative basal ganglia disease including movement disorders, cognitive alterations, and psychiatric symptoms. Neuromuscular manifestations include a (mostly subclinical) sensorimotor axonopathy and muscle weakness or atrophy of different degrees. Cardiac manifestations include dilated cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation, and tachyarrhythmia. Hematologically, MLS is defined as a specific blood group phenotype (named after the first proband, Hugh McLeod) that results from absent expression of the Kx erythrocyte antigen and weakened expression of Kell blood group antigens. The hematologic manifestations are red blood cell acanthocytosis and compensated hemolysis. Alloantibodies in the Kell and Kx blood group system can cause strong reactions to transfusions of incompatible blood and severe anemia in affected male newborns of Kell-negative mothers. Females heterozygous for XK pathogenic variants have mosaicism for the Kell and Kx blood group antigens. Although they usually lack CNS and neuromuscular manifestations, some heterozygous females may develop clinical manifestations including chorea or late-onset cognitive decline.

Management Treatment of manifestations: The following recommendations apply to affected males (although symptomatic heterozygous females may undergo the same procedures, no scientific data are available): use of dopamine antagonists (e.g., tiapride, clozapine, quetiapine) and the dopamine depletory (tetrabenazine) to ameliorate chorea; assessment of cardiac involvement initially with cardiac MRI (if available), Holter electrocardiogram (EKG), echocardiography, cardiac biomarkers, and specialized electrophysiological investigations (if indicated); consideration of placement of prophylactic cardiac pacemaker / implantable cardioverter-defibrillator; treatment of psychiatric problems and seizures based on clinical findings; long-term and continuous multidisciplinary psychosocial support for affected individuals and their families. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Blood transfusions with Kx antigens in males with MLS. Kx-negative blood or, if possible, banked autologous or homologous blood should be used. Evaluation of relatives at risk: It is appropriate to clarify the genetic status of apparently asymptomatic male and female at-risk relatives of any age in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from (1) detailed blood compatibility information to prevent transfusion of Kx+ homologous blood products, (2) possible prophylactic cryopreservation of autologous or homologous blood for use in future transfusions, and (3) interventions to prevent sudden cardiac events. Surveillance: For those with known cardiac involvement, follow up per treating specialist; for those without known cardiac involvement, Holter EKG, echocardiography, and cardiac biomarkers (e.g., troponin T/I, pro BNP) every two years; monitor for seizures; monitor serum CK concentrations for evidence of rhabdomyolysis if excessive movement disorders are present or if neuroleptic medications are being used. Genetic counseling MLS is inherited in an X-linked manner. If the mother of an affected male is heterozygous, the chance of transmitting the XK pathogenic variant in each pregnancy is 50%. Males who inherit the XK variant will be affected; females who inherit the XK variant will be heterozygous and will usually not be affected. Affected males pass the XK pathogenic variant to all of their daughters and none of their sons. Once the XK pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, carrier testing for at-risk females, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk, and preimplantation genetic testing are possible."

MDC1A is typically characterized by neonatal profound hypotonia, poor spontaneous movements, and respiratory failure. Failure to thrive, gastroesophageal reflux, aspiration, and recurrent chest infections necessitating frequent hospitalizations are common. As disease progresses, facial muscle weakness, temporomandibular joint contractures, and macroglossia may further impair feeding and can affect speech. In late-onset LAMA2-MD onset of manifestations range from early childhood to adulthood. Affected individuals may show muscle hypertrophy and develop a rigid spine syndrome with joint contractures, usually most prominent in the elbows. Progressive respiratory insufficiency, scoliosis, and cardiomyopathy can occur. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of LAMA2 muscular dystrophy is established in a proband with suggestive findings and biallelic (homozygous or compound heterozygous) pathogenic variants in LAMA2 identified by molecular genetic testing.

The deletion itself may not lead to a clinically recognizable syndrome and a subset of persons with the recurrent deletion have no obvious clinical findings, implying that penetrance for the deletion is incomplete. A little over half of individuals diagnosed with this recurrent deletion have intellectual disability or developmental delay, mainly in the areas of speech acquisition and cognitive function. In the majority of individuals, cognitive impairment is mild. Other features reported in diagnosed individuals include epilepsy (in ~30%), mild hypotonia, and neuropsychiatric disorders (including autism spectrum disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, mood disorder, schizophrenia, and aggressive or self-injurious behavior). Congenital malformations are uncommon. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of the 15q13.3 recurrent deletion is established in a proband by the presence of a heterozygous recurrent 2.0-Mb deletion at the approximate position of 30.5-32.5 Mb in the reference genome (chr15:30366247-32929476 [GRCh37/hg19]) that includes deletion of 1.5 Mb of unique sequence as well as an additional 500 kb or more of segmental duplications.

Of note, the significant bias in ascertainment of individuals undergoing clinical chromosomal microarray analysis (i.e., children with intellectual disability and developmental delay; individuals with schizophrenia) makes it difficult to accurately associate specific phenotypes with the 16p12.2 recurrent deletion. Findings commonly observed in children (probands) with this deletion include: developmental delay, cognitive impairment (ranging from mild to profound), growth impairment (including short stature), cardiac malformations, epilepsy, and psychiatric and/or behavioral issues. Other findings can include: hearing loss, dental abnormalities, renal and genital anomalies (the latter in males), and cleft palate cleft lip. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of 16p12.2 recurrent deletion is established by identification of a 520-kb heterozygous deletion on chromosome 16p12.2 on chromosomal microarray analysis or other genomic analyses. Management Treatment of manifestations: Treatment is directed to specific problems identified and may include developmental therapies; routine treatment of cardiac malformations, epilepsy, psychiatric and behavioral issues, hearing loss, and other malformations (e.g., orofacial clefting; renal, genitourinary, and dental anomalies).

Using a method of data analysis that avoids ascertainment bias, the authors determined that multicystic kidneys and other structural and functional kidney anomalies occur in 85% to 90% of affected individuals, MODY5 in approximately 40%, and some degree of developmental delay or learning disability in approximately 50%. MODY5 is most often diagnosed before age 25 years (range: age 10-50 years). Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis is established in a proband by detection of the 1.4-megabase (Mb) heterozygous recurrent deletion at chromosome 17q12 by chromosomal microarray testing or other genomic methods. Management Treatment of manifestations: Treatment of kidney anomalies, neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders, MODY5, genital tract abnormalities, liver abnormalities, eye abnormalities, congenital heart defects, seizures and sensorineural hearing loss should follow standard practice. Surveillance: Kidneys and urinary tract: In the absence of known structural abnormalities, kidney and bladder ultrasound examination 12 months after establishing the diagnosis, then every 2-3 years in childhood/ adolescence, then every 3-5 years in adulthood; presence of an abnormality may warrant more frequent monitoring.

GeneReviews ultrasound examination; more frequent monitoring may be advised in those taking potentially nephrotoxic medications and/or known to have impaired kidney function. Routine monitoring of neurodevelopment through early childhood; full neuropsychological evaluation for children who experience difficulty with school. HbA1C annually to monitor for MODY5; self-monitoring by individuals and their families for clinical signs and symptoms of diabetes mellitus, such as polydipsia and polyuria. Consider reevaluation for uterine and vaginal abnormalities related to mllerian duct aplasia in pubertal females with primary amenorrhea. Consider annual hepatic function panel (or comprehensive metabolic panel), GGT, and lipid panel. Annual ophthalmologic evaluation during early childhood. Monitor those with seizures as clinically indicated. Hearing screening throughout childhood. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Because kidney transplantation increases the risk for post-transplant diabetes mellitus, an immunosuppressive regimen that avoids tacrolimus and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors and reduces corticosteroid exposure may benefit those without preexisting diabetes mellitus. Nephrotoxic and hepatotoxic drugs should be avoided by individuals with kidney or liver abnormalities. For individuals with mental health conditions such as autism, schizophrenia, or bipolar disorder, careful consideration of antipsychotic agents that may lead to weight gain is recommended, as this potential increase has been associated with metabolic syndrome and the later development of diabetes mellitus, for which people with 17q12 deletions are at baseline increased risk. Likewise, the use of mood stabilizers that affect kidney function in the long term, such as lithium, should be carefully considered in the setting of potential underlying anatomic and functional abnormalities in people with 17q12 deletions. Evaluation of relatives at risk: If one of the proband's parents has the 17q12 recurrent deletion, it is appropriate to test older and younger sibs of the proband and other relatives at risk in order to identify those who would benefit from close assessment/monitoring for evidence of genitourinary structural or functional defects, MODY5, and developmental delays / intellectual disability. Genetic counseling The 17q12 recurrent deletion is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, with approximately 75% of deletions occurring de novo and approximately 25% inherited from a parent. If the 17q12 recurrent deletion identified in the proband is not found in one of the parents, the risk to sibs is presumed to be lower than 1% (but slightly greater than that of the general population because of the theoretic possibility of parental germline mosaicism for the deletion). Offspring of an individual with the 17q12 recurrent deletion have a 50% chance of inheriting the deletion. Prenatal testing and preimplantation genetic testing using genomic testing that will detect the 17q12 recurrent deletion are possible."

Clinical characteristics 9q22.3 microdeletion, which includes deletion of PTCH1, the gene that is mutated in Gorlin syndrome (nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome), is characterized by the clinical findings of this well-described disorder as well as developmental delay and/or intellectual disability, metopic craniosynostosis, obstructive hydrocephalus, pre- and postnatal macrosomia, and seizures. Affected individuals are also at increased risk for Wilms tumor. Common findings in Gorlin syndrome include: calcification of the falx cerebri prior to age 20 years; basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) of the skin; jaw keratocysts; palmar/plantar skin pits; and increased risk for childhood medulloblastomas as well as cardiac and ovarian fibromas. The clinical spectrum of the 9q22.3 microdeletion is variable and the clinical findings depend somewhat on the size of the microdeletion. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of the 9q22.3 microdeletion is confirmed by demonstration of a heterozygous microdeletion at chromosome 9q22.3. The minimal critical region that is deleted recurrently in affected individuals (but not in controls) is 352 kb, and includes PTCH1 and FANCC. The 9q22.3 microdeletion cannot be identified by routine analysis of G-banded chromosomes or other conventional cytogenetic banding techniques, except with extremely large deletions.

Surgical intervention as needed for excision or treatment of mandibular keratocysts, basal cell carcinomas, or other tumors that develop, or for management or correction of physical anomalies. Prevention of primary manifestations: Limiting exposure to ionizing radiation, such as by computed tomography and x-rays. Surveillance: Routine monitoring of head circumference and neurologic status throughout childhood with prompt evaluation by a neurologist and/or neurosurgeon for increasing head size, behavioral changes, or change in consciousness for evidence of obstructive hydrocephalus, medulloblastoma, and/or other cerebral tumors. Regular abdominal ultrasound for Wilms tumor, similar to surveillance for Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, is recommended. In those over age eight years, orthopantogram every 12-18 months to identify jaw keratocysts and skin examination at least annually. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Excessive sun exposure; use of radiotherapy because of risk of developing multiple BCCs in the treated area. Pregnancy management: Cesarean section delivery may be required for affected fetuses with macrocephaly. Genetic counseling The 9q22.3 microdeletion is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. In the majority of individuals, the microdeletion appears to result from either a de novo event or inheritance of an unbalanced chromosome rearrangement from a parent with a balanced rearrangement; however, inheritance of a deletion from a symptomatic parent mosaic for the deletion has been reported. When neither parent has a balanced chromosome rearrangement or deletion, recurrence risk for future pregnancies is low (probably <5%), but greater than that of the general population because parents may have germline mosaicism or low-level somatic mosaicism that also includes the germline. Prenatal testing is possible for pregnancies at increased risk based on identification of a balanced chromosome rearrangement or a deletion in a parent, and for parents concerned about the possibility of germline mosaicism."

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics MELAS (mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes) is a multisystem disorder with protean manifestations. The vast majority of affected individuals develop signs and symptoms of MELAS between ages two and 40 years. Common clinical manifestations include stroke-like episodes, encephalopathy with seizures and/or dementia, muscle weakness and exercise intolerance, normal early psychomotor development, recurrent headaches, recurrent vomiting, hearing impairment, peripheral neuropathy, learning disability, and short stature. During the stroke-like episodes neuroimaging shows increased T2-weighted signal areas that do not correspond to the classic vascular distribution (hence the term \\\"stroke-like\\\"). Lactic acidemia is very common and muscle biopsies typically show ragged red fibers. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of MELAS is based on meeting clinical diagnostic criteria and identifying a pathogenic variant in one of the genes associated with MELAS. The m.3243A>G pathogenic variant in the mitochondrial gene MT- TL1 is present in approximately 80% of individuals with MELAS. Pathogenic variants in MT-TL1 or other mtDNA genes, particularly MT-ND5, can also cause this disorder. Management Treatment of manifestations: Treatment for MELAS is generally supportive. During the acute stroke-like episode, a bolus of intravenous arginine (500 mg/kg for children or 10 g/m2 body surface area for adults) within three hours of symptom onset is recommended followed by the administration of a similar dosage of intravenous arginine as a continuous infusion over 24 hours for the next three to five days.

GeneReviews implantation; seizures respond to traditional anticonvulsant therapy (although valproic acid should be avoided). Ptosis, cardiomyopathy, cardiac conduction defects, nephropathy, and migraine headache are treated in the standard manner. Diabetes mellitus is managed by dietary modification, oral hypoglycemic agents, or insulin therapy. Exercise intolerance and weakness may respond to aerobic exercise. Prevention of primary manifestations: Once an individual with MELAS has the first stroke-like episode, arginine should be administered prophylactically to reduce the risk of recurrent stroke-like episodes. A daily dose of 150 to 300 mg/kg/day oral arginine in three divided doses is recommended. Prevention of secondary complications: Because febrile illnesses may trigger acute exacerbations, individuals with MELAS should receive standard childhood vaccinations, flu vaccine, and pneumococcal vaccine. Surveillance: Affected individuals and their at-risk relatives should be followed at regular intervals to monitor progression and the appearance of new symptoms. Annual ophthalmologic, audiology, and cardiologic (electrocardiogram and echocardiogram) evaluations are recommended. Annual urinalysis and fasting blood glucose level are also recommended. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Mitochondrial toxins, including aminoglycoside antibiotics, linezolid, cigarettes, and alcohol; valproic acid for seizure treatment; metformin because of its propensity to cause lactic acidosis; dichloroacetate (DCA) because of increased risk for peripheral neuropathy. Pregnancy management: Affected or at-risk pregnant women should be monitored for diabetes mellitus and respiratory insufficiency, which may require therapeutic interventions Genetic counseling MELAS is caused by pathogenic variants in mtDNA and is transmitted by maternal inheritance. The father of a proband is not at risk of having the mtDNA pathogenic variant. The mother of a proband usually has the mtDNA pathogenic variant and may or may not have symptoms. A man with a mtDNA pathogenic variant cannot transmit the variant to any of his offspring. A woman with a mtDNA pathogenic variant (whether symptomatic or asymptomatic) transmits the variant to all of her offspring. Prenatal testing and preimplantation genetic testing for MELAS is possible if a mtDNA pathogenic variant has been detected in the mother. However, because the mutational load in embryonic and fetal tissues sampled (i.e., amniocytes and chorionic villi) may not correspond to that of all fetal tissues, and because the mutational load in tissues sampled prenatally may shift in utero or after birth as a result of random mitotic segregation, prediction of the phenotype from prenatal studies cannot be made with certainty."

Parathyroid tumors are the most common MEN1-associated endocrinopathy; onset in 90% of individuals is between ages 20 and 25 years with hypercalcemia evident by age 50 years; hypercalcemia causes lethargy, depression, confusion, anorexia, constipation, nausea, vomiting, diuresis, dehydration, hypercalciuria, kidney stones, increased bone resorption/fracture risk, hypertension, and shortened QT interval. Pituitary tumors include prolactinoma (the most common), which manifests as oligomenorrhea/ amenorrhea and galactorrhea in females and sexual dysfunction in males. Well-differentiated endocrine tumors of the gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) tract can manifest as Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (gastrinoma); hypoglycemia (insulinoma); hyperglycemia, anorexia, glossitis, anemia, diarrhea, venous thrombosis, and skin rash (glucagonoma); and watery diarrhea, hypokalemia, and achlorhydria syndrome (vasoactive intestinal peptide [VIP]-secreting tumor). Carcinoid tumors are non-hormone-secreting and can manifest as a large mass after age 50 years. Adrenocortical tumors can be associated with primary hypercortisolism or hyperaldosteronism. Non-endocrine tumors include facial angiofibromas, collagenomas, lipomas, meningiomas, ependymomas, and leiomyomas.

Diagnosis/testing GeneReviews The clinical diagnosis of MEN1 can be established in a proband with: Two or more endocrine tumors including parathyroid, anterior pituitary, and/or GEP tract tumors or one endocrine tumor (parathyroid, anterior pituitary, or GEP tract tumor); and A first-degree relative with MEN1. The molecular diagnosis can be established by identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in MEN1 on molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Hyperparathyroidism is treated with subtotal parathyroidectomy and cryopreservation of parathyroid tissue or total parathyroidectomy and autotransplantation of parathyroid tissue; measure parathyroid hormone (PTH) and/or serum calcium to assess for hypoparathyroidism following subtotal or total parathyroidectomy; calcimimetics are used to treat primary hyperparathyroidism in those for whom surgery is contraindicated or has failed; prior to surgery, bone antiresorptive agents are used to reduce hypercalcemia and limit bone resorption. Prolactinomas are treated with dopamine agonists (cabergoline being the drug of choice). Growth hormone-secreting tumors causing acromegaly are treated by transsphenoidal surgery; medical therapy for growth hormone-secreting tumors includes somatostatin analogs, octreotide, and lanreotide. Adrenocorticotrophic hormone-secreting pituitary tumors associated with Cushing disease are surgically removed; nonsecreting pituitary adenomas are treated by transsphenoidal surgery. Proton pump inhibitors or H2-receptor blockers reduce gastric acid output caused by gastrinomas. Surgery is indicated for insulinoma and most other pancreatic tumors. Long-acting somatostatin analogs can control the secretory hyperfunction associated with carcinoid syndrome. Surgery is suggested for adrenal tumors greater than 4 cm in diameter, for tumors 1-4 cm in diameter with atypical or suspicious radiologic features, or for tumors that show significant measurable growth over a six-month interval. Measure urinary catecholamines prior to surgery to diagnose and treat a pheochromocytoma to avoid blood pressure peaks during surgery. Skin lesions in individuals with MEN1 are treated the same way as for the general population. Prevention of primary manifestations: Thymectomy may prevent thymic carcinoid in males, particularly in smokers. Surveillance: Annual fasting serum calcium, and consider fasting serum intact PTH from age five years; annual serum prolactin, IGF-1, fasting glucose, and insulin from age five years; head MRI every three to five years from age five years; annual chromogranin-A, pancreatic polypeptide, glucagon, and vasoactive intestinal peptide for other pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors from age eight years; annual fasting serum gastrin from age 20 years; consider abdominal CT, MRI, or endoscopic ultrasound every three to five years from age 20 years; consider chest CT, MRI, or somatostatin receptor scintigraphy octreotide scan annually from age 15 years; consider annual skin exam. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Smoking increases the risk of carcinoid tumors. Evaluation of relatives at risk: Because early detection affects management, molecular genetic testing is offered to at-risk members of a family in which a germline MEN1 pathogenic variant has been identified. Pregnancy management: Women with primary hyperparathyroidism from any cause are at increased risk of developing preeclampsia; infants born to women with primary hyperparathyroidism should be monitored for postnatal hypocalcemia. Endocrine Neoplasia Type 1 3 Genetic counseling MEN1 is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Approximately 90% of individuals diagnosed with MEN1 have an affected parent; approximately 10% of individuals diagnosed with MEN1 have the disorder as the result of a de novo MEN1 pathogenic variant that occurred in early embryogenesis. Each child (regardless of sex) of an individual with MEN1 has a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant. Once the MEN1 pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing for MEN1 are possible."

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2) includes the following phenotypes: MEN2A, familial medullary thyroid carcinoma (FMTC, which may be a variant of MEN2A), and MEN2B. All three phenotypes involve high risk for development of medullary carcinoma of the thyroid (MTC); MEN2A and MEN2B involve an increased risk for pheochromocytoma; MEN2A involves an increased risk for parathyroid adenoma or hyperplasia. Additional features of MEN2B include mucosal neuromas of the lips and tongue, distinctive facies with enlarged lips, ganglioneuromatosis of the gastrointestinal tract, and a marfanoid habitus. MTC typically occurs in early childhood in MEN2B, early adulthood in MEN2A, and middle age in FMTC. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of MEN2 is established in a proband who fulfills existing clinical diagnostic criteria or by identification of a heterozygous germline gain-of-function variant in RET on molecular genetic testing. Molecular genetic testing is recommended in all individuals with a clinical diagnosis due to genotype-specific surveillance and treatment recommendations and to allow family studies. Management Targeted therapy: Prophylactic thyroidectomy for individuals with an identified germline RET pathogenic variant. Supportive care: Measurement of plasma free metanephrines or 24-hour urine for fractionated metanephrines to evaluate for functioning pheochromocytoma prior to any surgery in individuals with MEN2A, MEN2B, or FMTC. Adrenalectomy prior to thyroidectomy in any individual with pheochromocytoma identified. Treatment for MTC is surgical removal of the thyroid gland and lymph node dissection.

Treatment of hypertension prior to adrenalectomy or management of hypertension during surgery. Resection of pheochromocytomas by adrenalectomy. Primary hyperparathyroidism is treated with surgery to remove one or more parathyroid glands or, more rarely, with medications to reduce parathyroid hormone secretion. Surveillance: Annual measurement of serum calcitonin concentration in those who have not had prophylactic thyroidectomy and to detect residual or recurrent MTC after thyroidectomy, even if thyroidectomy was performed prior to biochemical evidence of disease. Annual plasma free metanephrines or 24-hour urine for fractionated metanephrines for those with a germline RET pathogenic variant whose initial screening results are negative for pheochromocytoma. Annual albumin-corrected calcium or ionized calcium for individuals with MEN2A/FMTC whose initial screening results are negative for hyperparathyroidism. Age of initiation of surveillance for pheochromocytoma and hyperparathyroidism is determined by the specific germline RET pathogenic variant identified. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Dopamine D2 receptor antagonists and beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists present a high risk for adverse reactions in individuals with pheochromocytoma. Evaluation of relatives at risk: RET molecular genetic testing should be offered to all at-risk members of kindreds in which a germline RET pathogenic variant has been identified. When an individual with MEN2 refuses to notify at-risk family members, the physician should consider consulting a clinical ethicist to determine if the physician has the ethical obligation to warn the at-risk family members. Pregnancy management: Women with MEN2 should be screened for pheochromocytoma prior to a planned pregnancy or as early as possible during an unplanned pregnancy. Genetic counseling All MEN2 phenotypes are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Up to 95% of individuals diagnosed with MEN2A and 50% of individuals diagnosed with MEN2B have an affected parent. (By definition, individuals with FMTC have multiple family members who are affected.) Approximately 5%-9% of individuals with MEN2A and 50% of individuals with MEN2B have the disorder as the result of a de novo germline pathogenic variant. Each child of an individual with MEN2 has a 50% chance of inheriting the RET pathogenic variant. Once the RET pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, molecular genetic testing of at-risk asymptomatic family members and prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing for MEN2 are possible."

Parathyroid adenomas and parathyroid hyperplasia manifest as hypercalcemia (primary hyperparathyroidism) as a result of the overproduction of parathyroid hormone. Anterior pituitary adenomas can secrete adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH), growth hormone (GH), prolactin, or are nonfunctional (nonsecreting) adenomas. Well-differentiated endocrine tumors of the gastroenteropancreatic tract, carcinoid tumors, and adrenocortical tumors can also occur. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of MEN4 is established in a proband with a germline heterozygous pathogenic variant in CDKN1B identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Parathyroidectomy for primary hyperparathyroidism; cinacalcet may be considered in those with symptomatic hypercalcemia who are not surgical candidates; surgical resection for pituitary adenomas that secrete ACTH or GH; cabergoline for prolactin-secreting tumors; surgical resection for neuroendocrine and carcinoid tumors if possible; some individuals may be treated with somatostatin analogs; proton pump inhibitors for individuals with gastrin-secreting tumors.

    "chunk_text": "Clinical description Menkes disease, occipital horn syndrome (OHS), and ATP7A-related distal motor neuropathy (DMN) are disorders caused by pathogenic variants in the ATP7A, the X-linked gene that encodes a copper-transporting ATPase. Classic Menkes disease typically presents after a six- to 12-week period of good health following a normal pregnancy and birth. Feeding difficulties and/or a seizure event are the usual initial presenting features. In the absence of a known or suspected positive family history, these issues prompt a diagnostic evaluation that may consume months, by which time hypotonia and significant neurodevelopmental delays are evident. OHS is milder neurologically and is not recognized until late childhood or adolescence. Both phenotypes involve subnormal serum copper levels and other manifestations of perturbed copper metabolism, including connective tissue weakness. In contrast, ATP7A-related DMN typically presents in early adulthood with isolated muscle weakness and atrophy, in the absence of overt copper metabolism abnormalities. While nonspecific temperature instability and hypoglycemia in the neonatal period may be noted retrospectively, infants with classic Menkes disease appear healthy until age 1.5 to three months, when loss of developmental milestones, hypotonia, seizures, and failure to thrive occur. The diagnosis is usually suspected when infants exhibit neurologic findings and concomitant characteristic changes of the hair (short, sparse, coarse, twisted, and often lightly pigmented). Without treatment, premature death is typical, often by age three years. OHS is characterized by \\\"occipital horns,\\\" distinctive wedge-shaped calcifications at the sites of attachment of the trapezius muscle and the sternocleidomastoid muscle to the occipital bone. Occipital horns may be clinically palpable or observed on skull radiographs. Individuals with OHS also have lax skin and joints, bladder diverticula, inguinal hernias, and vascular tortuosity. Intellect is normal or slightly reduced. ATP7A-related DMN, an adult-onset disorder resembling Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, shares none of the clinical or biochemical abnormalities characteristic of Menkes disease or OHS.

Copyright 1993-2024, University of Washington, Seattle. GeneReviews is a registered trademark of the University of Washington, Seattle. All rights reserved. Diagnosis/testing GeneReviews Menkes disease and OHS are characterized by low concentrations of copper in some tissues as a result of impaired intestinal copper absorption, accumulation of copper in other tissues, and reduced activity of copper- dependent enzymes such as dopamine-beta-hydroxylase (DBH) and lysyl oxidase. While serum copper concentration and serum ceruloplasmin concentration are low in Menkes disease and OHS, they are normal in ATP7A-related DMN. Notably, serum copper and ceruloplasmin levels are low in healthy newborns for the first several months of life; thus, these are not reliable diagnostic biomarkers in infants younger than age two months. The diagnosis of ATP7A-related copper transport disorders is most often confirmed in a proband by detection of either a hemizygous ATP7A pathogenic variant in a male or a heterozygous ATP7A pathogenic variant in a female with skewed X inactivation, or with a X-autosome translocation; the latter scenarios are quite rare. Management Prevention of primary manifestations (and treatment): Subcutaneous injections of copper histidinate beginning by age 28 days (corrected for prematurity/gestational age) enhances survival and improves neurodevelopmental outcomes. Treatment of manifestations: Classic Menkes disease. Seizure management per neurologist; early intervention and individualized education plan per developmental pediatrician, feeding therapy and gastrostomy tube placement to enhance caloric intake; antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent bladder infection and surgery for bladder diverticula; RSV, influenza and COVID vaccinations due to risk of recurrent pneumonia; social work support. Occipital horn syndrome. Possible droxidopa treatment for dysautonomia; early academic support and individualized education plan as indicated per developmental pediatrician; surgical treatment of bladder diverticula and antibiotic prophylaxis as necessary; physical therapy; joint splints per orthopedist or rheumatologist for joint laxity. ATP7A-related distal motor neuropathy. Special shoes with good ankle support; ankle-foot orthoses; physical therapy; occupational therapy; orthopedic surgery for severe pes cavus deformity; mobility devices; and exercise as tolerated. Surveillance: Menkes disease. At each visit assess seizures, developmental progress, educational needs, growth and nutrition, therapy needs, mobility, self-help skills, frequency of pulmonary infections, and family needs. Occipital horn syndrome. At each visit assess orthostatic blood pressures, development, and educational needs. Annual pelvic ultrasound for bladder diverticula. ATP7A-related distal motor neuropathy. Annual neurologic exam, electroneurography of peripheral nerves, electromyography/electroneurography, physical therapy assessment, occupational therapy assessment, foot examination for pressure sores or poorly fitting footwear. Genetic counseling The ATP7A-related copper transport disorders are inherited in an X-linked manner. Approximately one third of affected males have no family history of Menkes disease/OHS/DMN. If the mother is a heterozygote, the risk of transmitting the ATP7A pathogenic variant is 50% in each pregnancy: a male who inherits the pathogenic variant will be affected with the disorder present in his brother; females who inherit the pathogenic variant will be heterozygotes and generally will not be affected. Male Menkes disease survivors and males with OHS or ATP7A-related DMN theoretically could pass the pathogenic variant to all of their daughters and none of their Copper Transport Disorders 3 sons. When a pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, heterozygote testing for at- risk female relatives, prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk, and preimplantation genetic testing are possible."

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics MERRF (myoclonic epilepsy with ragged red fibers) is a multisystem disorder characterized by myoclonus (often the first symptom) followed by generalized epilepsy, ataxia, weakness, exercise intolerance, and dementia. Onset can occur from childhood to adulthood, occurring after normal early development. Common findings are ptosis, hearing loss, short stature, optic atrophy, cardiomyopathy, cardiac dysrhythmias such as Wolff-Parkinson- White syndrome, and peripheral neuropathy. Pigmentary retinopathy, optic neuropathy, diabetes mellitus, and lipomatosis have been observed. Diagnosis/testing A clinical diagnosis of MERRF can be established in a proband with the following four \\\"canonic\\\" features: myoclonus, generalized epilepsy, ataxia, and ragged red fibers (RRF) in the muscle biopsy. A molecular diagnosis is established in a proband with suggestive findings and a pathogenic variant in one of the genes associated with MERRF. The m.8344A>G pathogenic variant in the mitochondrial gene MT-TK is present in more than 80% of affected individuals with typical findings. Pathogenic variants in MT-TF, MT-TH, MT-TI, MT-TL1, MT-TP, MT- TS1, and MT-TS2 have also been described in a subset of individuals with MERRF. Management Treatment of manifestations: Ubiquinol, carnitine, alpha lipoic acid, vitamin E, vitamin B complex, and creatine may be of benefit to some individuals; traditional anticonvulsant therapy per neurologist for seizures; levetiracetam or clonazepam for myoclonus; physical therapy to improve any impaired motor function; aerobic exercise; standard pharmacologic therapy for cardiac symptoms; hearing aids or cochlear implants for hearing loss; diabetes mellitus treatment per endocrinologist. Prevention of primary manifestations: Coenzyme Q10 (50-200 mg 2-3x/day), L-carnitine (1000 mg 2-3x/day), alpha lipoic acid, vitamin E, vitamin B supplements, and creatine, often used to improve mitochondrial function, have been of modest benefit in some individuals.

GeneReviews Surveillance: Routine evaluations every six to 12 months initially; annual neurologic, ophthalmologic, cardiology (electrocardiogram and echocardiogram), and endocrinologic evaluations (fasting blood sugar and TSH); audiology evaluations every two to three years. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Mitochondrial toxins (e.g., aminoglycoside antibiotics, linezolid, cigarettes, alcohol); valproic acid should be avoided in the treatment of seizures. Pregnancy management: During pregnancy, affected or at-risk women should be monitored for diabetes mellitus and respiratory insufficiency, which may require therapeutic interventions. Genetic counseling MERRF is caused by pathogenic variants in mtDNA and is transmitted by maternal inheritance. The father of a proband is not at risk of having the mtDNA pathogenic variant. The mother of a proband usually has the mtDNA pathogenic variant and may or may not have symptoms. A male with a mtDNA pathogenic variant cannot transmit the pathogenic variant to any of his offspring. A female with a mtDNA pathogenic variant (whether symptomatic or asymptomatic) transmits the pathogenic variant to all of her offspring. Prenatal testing and preimplantation genetic testing for MERRF are possible if a mtDNA pathogenic variant has been detected in the mother. However, because the mutational load in embryonic and fetal tissues sampled (i.e., amniocytes and chorionic villi) may not correspond to that of all fetal tissues and because the mutational load in tissues sampled prenatally may shift in utero or after birth as a result of random mitotic segregation, prediction of the phenotype from prenatal studies is not possible."

Associated craniofacial malformations may include cleft palate, choanal atresia, zygomatic arch cleft (identified on cranial CT scan), and facial asymmetry. Other relatively common findings (present in 25%-35% of individuals) can include cardiac anomalies, thumb anomalies, esophageal atresia/tracheoesophageal fistula, short stature, spine anomalies, and epilepsy. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of MFDM is confirmed in a proband with typical clinical findings and a heterozygous pathogenic variant in EFTUD2 identified by genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Individualized treatment of craniofacial manifestations is managed by a multidisciplinary team which may include: oromaxillofacial surgery, plastic surgery, otolaryngology, dentistry/ orthodontics, and occupational and speech-language therapy. Newborn infants may have airway compromise at delivery due to choanal atresia and/or mandibular hypoplasia, requiring intubation and/or tracheostomy for initial stabilization. Esophageal atresia/tracheoesophageal fistula, cardiac defects, renal anomalies, and thumb anomalies are treated in a routine manner. Short stature is managed expectantly.

Distal muscle weakness is present in about 80% of individuals and is more pronounced than proximal weakness in about 25%. A minority of individuals experience sensory symptoms, muscle stiffness, aching, or cramps. Peripheral neuropathy is present in about 20% of affected individuals. Overt cardiomyopathy is present in 15%-30%. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of myofibrillar myopathy is based on clinical findings, electromyography (EMG), nerve conduction studies, and, most importantly, muscle histology. To date, the genetic basis of myofibrillar myopathy has been elucidated in only about 50% of cases.

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Malignant hyperthermia susceptibility (MHS) is a pharmacogenetic disorder of skeletal muscle calcium regulation associated with uncontrolled skeletal muscle hypermetabolism. Manifestations of malignant hyperthermia (MH) are precipitated by certain volatile anesthetics (i.e., halothane, isoflurane, sevoflurane, desflurane, enflurane), either alone or in conjunction with a depolarizing muscle relaxant (specifically, succinylcholine). The triggering substances cause uncontrolled release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and may promote entry of extracellular calcium into the myoplasm, causing contracture of skeletal muscles, glycogenolysis, and increased cellular metabolism, resulting in production of heat and excess lactate. Affected individuals experience acidosis, hypercapnia, tachycardia, hyperthermia, muscle rigidity, compartment syndrome, rhabdomyolysis with subsequent increase in serum creatine kinase (CK) concentration, hyperkalemia with a risk for cardiac arrhythmia or even cardiac arrest, and myoglobinuria with a risk for renal failure. In nearly all cases, the first manifestations of MH (tachycardia and tachypnea) occur in the operating room; however, MH may also occur in the early postoperative period. There is mounting evidence that some individuals with MHS will also develop MH with exercise and/or on exposure to hot environments. Without proper and prompt treatment with dantrolene sodium, mortality is extremely high. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of MHS is established with in vitro muscle contracture testing by measuring the contracture responses of biopsied muscle samples to halothane and graded concentrations of caffeine. The diagnosis of MHS can also be established by identification of a pathogenic variant in CACNA1S, RYR1, or STAC3 on molecular genetic testing.

Management GeneReviews Treatment of manifestations: Early diagnosis of an MH episode is essential. Successful treatment of an acute episode of MH includes: discontinuation of potent inhalation agents and succinylcholine; increase in minute ventilation to lower end-tidal CO2; use of MHAUS helpline; administration of dantrolene sodium intravenously; cooling measures if body temperature is >38.5 C; treatment of cardiac arrhythmias if needed (do not use calcium channel blockers); monitoring blood gases, serum concentrations of electrolytes and CK, blood and urine for myoglobin, and coagulation profile; treatment of metabolic abnormalities. Prevention of primary manifestations: Individuals with MHS should not be exposed to potent volatile agents and succinylcholine. Individuals undergoing general anesthetics that exceed 30 minutes in duration should have their temperature monitored using an electronic temperature probe. Individuals with MHS should carry proper identification as to their susceptibility. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Avoid potent inhalation anesthetics and succinylcholine. Calcium channel blockers should not be given together with dantrolene because of a potential cardiac depressant effect. Serotonin antagonist (5HT3-antagonist) antiemetics should be used cautiously. Individuals with MHS should avoid extremes of heat, but not restrict athletic activity unless there is a history of overt rhabdomyolysis and/or heat stroke. Strenuous activities at high ambient temperatures should be avoided or performed with caution. In individuals with MH undergoing cardiac bypass surgery, aggressive rewarming should be avoided, as it may be associated with development of clinical signs of MH. Evaluation of relatives at risk: If the MHS-causative pathogenic variant in the family is known, molecular genetic testing can be used to established increased risk of MH in a heterozygous individual; molecular genetic testing alone cannot be used to identify family members who are not at increased risk for MH because of other possible genetic risk factors. If the pathogenic variant in the family is not known or if an at-risk relative is found to be negative for a familial pathogenic variant, muscle contracture testing can be used to assess susceptibility to MH. Pregnancy management: If a pregnant woman with MHS requires a non-emergent surgery, a non-triggering anesthetic (local, nerve block, epidural, spinal anesthesia, or a total intravenous general anesthetic) should be administered. Continuous epidural analgesia is highly recommended for labor and delivery. If a cesarean delivery is indicated in a woman who does not have an epidural catheter in place, neuraxial (spinal, epidural, or combined spinal-epidural) anesthesia is recommended (if not otherwise contraindicated). If a general anesthetic is indicated, a total intravenous anesthetic technique should be administered, with an anesthesia machine that has been prepared for an MH-susceptible individual. Genetic counseling Malignant hyperthermia susceptibility (MHS) is an autosomal dominant disorder. Most individuals diagnosed with MHS have a parent with MHS, although the parent may not have experienced an episode of MH. The proportion of individuals with MHS caused by a de novo pathogenic variant is unknown. Each child of an individual with MHS has a 50% chance of inheriting a causative pathogenic variant. Prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk is possible if there is a known MH pathogenic variant in the family."

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics The defining clinical characteristics of the microcephaly-capillary malformation (MIC-CAP) syndrome are typically present at birth: microcephaly and generalized cutaneous capillary malformations (a few to hundreds of oval/circular macules or patches varying in size from 1-2 mm to several cm), hypoplastic distal phalanges of the hands and/or feet, early-onset intractable epilepsy, and profound developmental delay. Seizures, which can be focal, tonic, and complex partial and can include infantile spasms, appear to stabilize after age two years. Myoclonus of the limbs and eyelids is common; other abnormal movements (dyskinetic, choreiform) may be seen. To date, the diagnosis has been confirmed in 18 individuals from 15 families. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of MIC-CAP syndrome is established in a proband with suggestive findings and biallelic pathogenic variants in STAMBP identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Supportive care by multidisciplinary specialists including a medical geneticist, neurologist, developmental pediatrician, and feeding specialist is recommended. Central hypotonia and peripheral hypertonia require attention to proper seating and bracing to maintain posture and prevent contractures. Seizures require management by an experienced pediatric neurology team, as multiple anticonvulsant medications are frequently required for adequate seizure control. A feeding tube is essential to optimize nutrition and weight gain while reducing the risk of aspiration.

Agents/circumstances to avoid: Valproic acid may or may not be associated with adverse effects. Genetic counseling MIC-CAP syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by biallelic STAMBP pathogenic variants. Typically, one pathogenic variant is inherited from each parent; however, in some instances both pathogenic variants are inherited from one parent (uniparental isodisomy). If both parents are known to be heterozygous for a STAMBP pathogenic variant, each sib of an affected individual has at conception a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. If the proband has MIC-CAP syndrome as the result of uniparental isodisomy, only one parent is heterozygous for a STAMBP pathogenic variant, and if neither parent has a chromosome rearrangement, each sib of an affected individual has at conception a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier and an approximately 50% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. The risk to sibs of a proband of being affected is unknown but is presumed to be less than 1%. Once the STAMBP pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member (or if the proband has MIC-CAP as the result of uniparental isodisomy identification of the one familial STAMBP pathogenic variant), carrier testing for at-risk family members, prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk, and preimplantation genetic testing are possible."

Clinical characteristics Primary autosomal recessive microcephalies (MCPH) and Seckel syndrome (SCKS) spectrum disorders are characterized by microcephaly and the absence of visceral malformations. Although MCHP and SCKS were previously distinguished by height (maximum height in SCKS was equivalent to the minimum height in MCPH), stature is no longer a discriminating feature, leading to the conclusion that these phenotypes constitute a spectrum rather than distinct entities. Microcephaly is characterized by: Onset during the second trimester of gestation; Occipito-frontal head circumference (OFC) at birth equal to or less than -2 SD below the mean for sex, age, and ethnicity; Slower than average increase in OFC after birth.

Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of MCPH-SCKS spectrum disorders is based on clinical findings, brain imaging that shows reduced brain volume with grossly normal architecture, family history consistent with autosomal recessive inheritance, and molecular genetic testing when available. The genes in which biallelic mutation is known to cause MCPH-SCKS spectrum disorders are separated into those that are currently known to be associated with: MCPH phenotype only: MCPH1 (locus name MCPH1), WDR62 (MCPH2), CDK5RAP2 (MCPH3), KNL1 (MCPH4), ASPM (MCPH5), STIL (MCPH7), CEP135 (MCPH8), and CDK6 (MCPH12); SCKS phenotype only: ATR (locus name SCKL1), NIN (SCKL7), and ATRIP; and MCPH, SCKS, and/or intermediate phenotypes: RBBP8 (locus name SCKL2), CEP152 (MCPH9/SCKL5), CENPJ (MCPH6/SCKL4), CEP63 (SCKL6), and PHC1 (MCPH11). Of note, roughly one half to three quarters of western Europeans or North Americans with MCPH have no identified gene defect; in contrast, the proportion of individuals with identified pathogenic variants appears higher in persons from the Indo-Pakistan area. Management Treatment of manifestations: Supportive therapy including special education, speech and language therapy, behavioral therapy, occupational therapy, and community services for families. Ritalin may be helpful in managing hyperkinesia. Seizures are usually responsive to monotherapy with standard antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Surveillance: Neurologic follow up from birth to adulthood to detect behavioral difficulties, hyperactivity, attention disorder, and motor problems (spasticity), and to monitor for evidence of seizures, which can be late onset. Periodic neuropsychological evaluation to adapt interventions and schooling to the individual's abilities. Genetic counseling MCPH-SCKS spectrum disorders are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. At conception, each child of two carrier parents has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier.

Other findings can include a wide variety of other ocular abnormalities (e.g., corneal anomalies, orbital cysts, cataracts), central nervous system involvement (e.g., structural anomalies, developmental delay, infantile seizures), cardiac concerns (e.g., hypertrophic or oncocytic cardiomyopathy, atrial or ventricular septal defects, arrhythmias), short stature, diaphragmatic hernia, nail dystrophy, hearing impairment, and genitourinary malformations. Inter- and intrafamilial variability is described. Diagnosis/testing The clinical diagnosis is established when the two major criteria (microphthalmia and/or anophthalmia and linear skin defects) are present and confirmed by identification of a pathogenic variant in COX7B, HCCS, or NDUFB11. However, persons with a molecular diagnosis of MLS syndrome in whom only one of the two major criteria was present have been reported: some show characteristic skin defects without ocular abnormalities and others show eye abnormalities without skin defects.

Occasionally it presents later in life. The severity of edema shows both inter- and intrafamilial variability. Swelling is usually bilateral but can be asymmetric. The degree of edema can progress but, in some instances, can improve, particularly in the early years. Other features sometimes associated with Milroy disease include hydrocele (37% of males), prominent veins below the knees (23%), upslanting toenails (14%), papillomatosis (10%), and urethral abnormalities in males (4%).

Cytopenias are typically seen soon after birth; thrombocytopenia is the most common followed by anemia and pancytopenia. Recurrent infections from early infancy include pneumonia, urinary tract infection, gastroenteritis, meningitis, otitis media, dermatitis, subcutaneous abscess, and sepsis. Reported genital phenotypes in those with 46,XY karyotype included hypospadias, microphallus, bifid shawl scrotum, ambiguous genitalia, or complete female genitalia. Hypoplastic or dysgenetic ovaries have been reported in females. Gastrointestinal complications include chronic diarrhea and esophageal dysfunction. Moderate-to-severe developmental delay is reported in most affected individuals. Autonomic dysfunction and renal dysfunction are also reported.

Although mirror movements vary in severity, most affected individuals have strong and sustained mirror movements of a lesser amplitude than the corresponding voluntary movements. Mirror movements usually persist throughout life, without deterioration or improvement, and are not usually associated with subsequent onset of additional neurologic manifestations. However, a subset of affected individuals with a heterozygous pathogenic variant in DCC may have CMM with abnormalities of the corpus callosum and concomitant cognitive and/or neuropsychiatric issues.

MMD (median age of onset 19 years) is characterized by muscle weakness and atrophy, most marked in the distal parts of the legs, especially the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles. Over a period of years, the weakness and atrophy spread to the thighs and gluteal muscles.

HMC in infants usually presents as a large cystic abdominal mass arising out of the pelvis, caused by dilatation of the vagina and uterus as a result of the accumulation of cervical secretions from maternal estrogen stimulation. HMC can be caused by failure of the distal third of the vagina to develop (vaginal agenesis), a transverse vaginal membrane, or an imperforate hymen. PAP is the presence of additional digits on the ulnar side of the hand and the fibular side of the foot. A variety of congenital heart defects have been reported including atrioventricular canal, atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect, or a complex congenital heart malformation. Diagnosis/testing The clinical diagnosis of MKS can be established in a proband based on clinical diagnostic criteria of HMC and PAP in the absence of clinical or molecular genetic findings suggestive of an alternative diagnosis. The molecular diagnosis can be established in proband with suggestive findings and biallelic pathogenic variants in MKKS identified by molecular genetic testing. However, care must be taken to ensure that the proband does not have Bardet-Biedl syndrome, an allelic condition with considerable clinical overlap and age-dependent features including retinal dystrophy, obesity, and intellectual disability.

ML II is evident at birth and slowly progressive; death most often occurs in early childhood. Orthopedic abnormalities present at birth may include thoracic deformity, kyphosis, clubfeet, deformed long bones, and/or dislocation of the hip(s). Growth often ceases in the second year of life; contractures develop in all large joints. The skin is thickened, facial features are coarse, and gingiva are hypertrophic. All children have cardiac involvement, most commonly thickening and insufficiency of the mitral valve and, less frequently, the aortic valve. Progressive mucosal thickening narrows the airways, and gradual stiffening of the thoracic cage contributes to respiratory insufficiency, the most common cause of death.

Pain from osteoporosis becomes more severe during adolescence. Cardiorespiratory complications (restrictive lung disease, thickening and insufficiency of the mitral and aortic valves, left and/or right ventricular hypertrophy) are common causes of death, typically in early to middle adulthood. Phenotypes intermediate between ML II and ML III/ are characterized by physical growth in infancy that resembles that of ML II and neuromotor and speech development that resemble that of ML III/.

Clinical characteristics Mucolipidosis alpha/beta (ML III alpha/beta; pseudo-Hurler polydystrophy), a slowly progressive disorder with clinical onset at approximately age three years, is characterized by slow growth rate and subnormal stature; radiographic evidence of mild to moderate dysostosis multiplex; joint stiffness and pain initially in the shoulders, hips, and fingers; gradual mild coarsening of facial features; and normal to mildly impaired cognitive development. If present, organomegaly is mild. Pain from osteoporosis that is clinically and radiologically apparent in childhood becomes more severe from adolescence. Cardiorespiratory complications (restrictive lung disease, thickening and insufficiency of the mitral and aortic valves, left and/or right ventricular hypertrophy) are common causes of death, typically in early to middle adulthood. Diagnosis/testing In ML III alpha/beta the activity of nearly all lysosomal hydrolases is up to tenfold higher in plasma and other body fluids than in normal controls because of inadequate targeting to lysosomes. Urinary excretion of oligosaccharides (OSs), a nonspecific finding, is often excessive. Significant deficiency (1%-10% of normal) of the activity of the enzyme UDP-N-acetylglucosamine: lysosomal hydrolase N-acetylglucosamine-1- phosphotransferase (GNPTA), encoded by GNPTAB, confirms the diagnosis. Bidirectional sequencing of the entire GNPTAB coding region detects two pathogenic variants in more than 95% of individuals with ML III alpha/beta.

Management GeneReviews Treatment of manifestations: Low-impact physical therapy is usually well tolerated. Myringotomy tube placement may be indicated in the treatment of recurrent otitis media. Carpal tunnel signs may require tendon release. In late childhood or early adolescence symptomatic relief of hip pain may be initially accomplished with over-the- counter analgesics; in some older adolescents and adults with milder phenotypic variants, bilateral hip replacement has been successful. Later in the disease course management focuses on relief of general bone pain associated with osteoporosis, which has responded in a few individuals to scheduled intermittent IV administration of the bisphosphonate pamidronate. Prevention of secondary complications: Because of concerns about airway management, surgical intervention should be undertaken only in tertiary care settings with pediatric anesthesiologists and intensivists. Surveillance: Twice-yearly outpatient clinic visits for young children; annual routine follow-up visits after age six years unless bone pain, deteriorating ambulation, and/or cardiac and respiratory monitoring need more frequent attention. Genetic counseling ML III alpha/beta is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. At conception, each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier.

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Mucolipidosis III gamma (ML III) is a slowly progressive inborn error of metabolism mainly affecting skeletal, joint, and connective tissues. Clinical onset is in early childhood; the progressive course results in severe functional impairment and significant morbidity from chronic pain. Cardiorespiratory complications (restrictive lung disease from thoracic involvement, and thickening and insufficiency of the mitral and aortic valves) are rarely clinically significant. A few (probably <10%) affected individuals display mild cognitive impairment. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of ML III is established in a proband with suggestive clinical and radiographic findings and biallelic pathogenic variants in GNPTG identified on molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: No measures are known to be effective in treating the progressive limitation of motion in large and small joints. Low-impact physical therapy is usually well tolerated. In older adolescents and adults joint replacement has been successful in relieving hip pain and knee pain. Carpal tunnel signs, and rarely tarsal tunnel symptoms, may require surgical tendon release procedures for temporary relief. Later in the disease course when bone pain of variable intensity may become frequent, management focuses on pain relief. Bisphosphonate treatment in individuals with significant skeletal disease and markedly decreased bone mineral densitometry can be considered. When significant cardiac valvular dysfunction disrupts ventricular function, valve replacement needs to be considered. Addressing the social and emotional needs of affected individuals and their families is recommended.

Individuals with MLIV typically present by the end of the first year of life with delayed developmental milestones (due to a developmental brain abnormality) and impaired vision (resulting from a combination of corneal clouding and retinal degeneration). By adolescence, all individuals with MLIV have severe visual impairment. A neurodegenerative component of MLIV has become more widely appreciated, with the majority of individuals demonstrating progressive spastic quadriparesis and loss of psychomotor skills starting in the second decade of life. About 5% of individuals have atypical MLIV, manifesting with less severe psychomotor impairment, but still exhibiting progressive retinal degeneration and achlorhydria. Diagnosis/testing MLIV is suspected in individuals with typical clinical findings and elevated plasma gastrin concentration or polymorphic lysosomal inclusions in skin or conjunctival biopsy. Identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in MCOLN1 confirms the diagnosis. Management Treatment of manifestations: Developmental and educational services including speech therapy; physical therapy and bracing for hypotonia and spasticity; intramuscular botulinum toxin injections or oral medications for muscle spasticity and rigidity as needed; anti-seizure medication as needed; surgical correction of strabismus; high-contrast black and white materials for those with visual impairment; topical lubricating eye drops, artificial tears, gels, or ointments for ocular irritation; feeding therapy and/or gastrostomy tube placement may be Author Affiliations: 1 Department of Neurology Massachusetts General Hospital Harvard Medical School Boston, Massachusetts; Email: amisko@mgh.harvard.edu. 2 Department of Neurology Massachusetts General Hospital Center for Genomic Medicine Harvard Medical School Boston, Massachusetts; Email: ygrishchuk@mgh.harvard.edu. 3 Section on Molecular Neurogenetics Medical Genetics Branch National Human Genome Research Institute National Institutes of Health Bethesda, Maryland; Email: goldine@mail.nih.gov. 4 Baylor Scott & White Research Institute Dallas, Texas; Email: raphael.schiffmann@bswhealth.org.

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy with subcortical cysts (MLC) is characterized by two phenotypes: classic MLC and improving MLC. Individuals with classic MLC present with macrocephaly, often in association with seizures, gradual onset of ataxia, spasticity, and sometimes extrapyramidal findings, mild gross motor developmental delays, and late-onset cognitive deterioration. Macrocephaly, observed in most affected individuals, may be present at birth but more frequently develops during the first year of life. The degree of macrocephaly is variable, with head circumferences reaching four to six standard deviations greater than the mean. After the first year of life, head growth trajectory typically normalizes and growth follows a line parallel to, although several standard deviations above, the 98th centile. Initial mental and motor development is normal in most individuals. Walking is often unstable, followed by ataxia of the trunk and extremities, pyramidal dysfunction, and brisk deep tendon reflexes. Early-onset seizures are common, and approximately 60% of individuals have epilepsy that is typically well controlled with anti-seizure medication, but status epilepticus occurs relatively frequently. Cognitive deterioration occurs later in the course of the disease and is usually mild in severity. Overall disease severity varies, with some individuals being able to ambulate independently for only a few years from disease onset to other individuals continuing to independently walk in the fifth decade of life. Individuals with improving MLC have a similar initial presentation with delayed cognitive or motor development, followed by an improving clinical course: macrocephaly usually persists, but some children become normocephalic; motor function improves or normalizes; hypotonia and clumsiness may persist in some or neurologic examination may become normal. Some individuals have intellectual disability that is stable, with or without autism spectrum disorder. Epilepsy is much less frequent than in classic MLC.

Diagnosis/testing GeneReviews The diagnosis of classic MLC is established in individuals with suggestive clinical findings and characteristic abnormalities identified on brain MRI examination, including abnormal and swollen cerebral hemispheric white matter and subcortical cysts in the anterior temporal and often frontoparietal regions; and/or biallelic loss-of- function variants in MLC1 or HEPACAM or a heterozygous pathogenic variant in GPRC5B identified by molecular genetic testing. The diagnosis of improving MLC is established in individuals with suggestive clinical findings and a heterozygous gain-of-function variant in HEPACAM or biallelic pathogenic variants in AQP4 identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Physical therapy to improve motor function; speech therapy as needed; special education; anti-seizure medication to control seizures. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Contact sports and other activities associated with a high risk of head trauma should be avoided. Genetic counseling MLC is inherited in an autosomal recessive or an autosomal dominant manner. Classic MLC is most commonly caused by biallelic pathogenic variants in MLC1 or HEPACAM and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. If both parents of a child with MLC1-related classic MLC or biallelic HEPACAM-related classic MLC are known to be heterozygous for an MLC1 or HEPACAM pathogenic variant, each sib of an affected individual has at conception a 25% chance of inheriting biallelic pathogenic variants and being affected, a 50% chance of being heterozygous, and a 25% chance of inheriting neither of the familial pathogenic variants. Once the autosomal recessive MLC-related pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member, carrier testing for at-risk relatives is possible. Rarely, classic MLC occurs as an autosomal dominant disorder caused by a heterozygous GPRC5B pathogenic variant. All individuals with GPRC5B-related classic MLC reported to date have had the disorder as a result of a de novo pathogenic variant. Improving MLC most commonly occurs as an autosomal dominant disorder caused by an inherited or de novo pathogenic variant in HEPACAM. Approximately 20% of individuals with heterozygous HEPACAM- related improving MLC have the disorder as a result of a de novo pathogenic variant. Each child of an individual with heterozygous HEPACAM-related improving MLC has a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant. Rarely, improving MLC is due to biallelic pathogenic variants in AQP4 and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Once the MLC-related pathogenic variant(s) have been identified in an affected family member, prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing for MLC are possible."

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Arylsulfatase A deficiency (also known as metachromatic leukodystrophy or MLD) is characterized by three clinical subtypes: late-infantile, juvenile, and adult MLD. The age of onset within a family is usually similar. The disease course may be from several years in the late-infantile-onset form to decades in the juvenile- and adult- onset forms. Late-infantile MLD: Onset is before age 30 months. Typical presenting findings include weakness, hypotonia, clumsiness, frequent falls, toe walking, and dysarthria. Language, cognitive, and gross and fine motor skills regress as the disease progresses. Later signs include spasticity, pain, seizures, and compromised vision and hearing. In the final stages, children have tonic spasms, decerebrate posturing, and general unawareness of their surroundings. Juvenile MLD: Onset is between age 30 months and 16 years. Initial manifestations include a decline in school performance and the emergence of behavioral problems, followed by gait disturbances. Progression is similar to but slower than in the late-infantile form. Adult MLD: Onset occurs after the age of 16 years, sometimes not until the fourth or fifth decade. Initial signs can include problems in school or job performance, personality changes, emotional lability, or psychosis; in others, neurologic symptoms (weakness and loss of coordination progressing to spasticity and incontinence) or seizures predominate initially. Peripheral neuropathy is common. The disease course is variable, with periods of stability interspersed with periods of decline, and may extend over two to three decades.

Management Targeted therapy: Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) can treat primary central nervous system manifestations in those with pre- and very early-symptomatic juvenile- or adult-onset MLD. Autologous HSCT using gene-modified hematopoietic stem cells (also known as ex vivo gene therapy) is approved in the United States, European Union, and United Kingdom for individuals with presymptomatic late-infantile MLD, presymptomatic early-onset juvenile MLD, or early-symptomatic early-onset juvenile MLD with maintained ability to walk and before the onset of cognitive decline. Supportive care: Developmental and educational support. Treatment per orthopedist, physical medicine and rehabilitation, and physical and occupational therapists to avoid contractures and falls and maintain neuromuscular function and mobility, muscle relaxants for contractures, and safety measures for gait or movement limitations. Feeding therapy, swallowing aids, suction equipment, and other standard treatments for drooling, swallowing difficulty, and gastroesophageal reflux. Gastrostomy tube as needed for feeding. Treatment of seizures using anti-seizure medications in standard protocols. Standard treatments for impaired vison and/or hearing and respiratory issues. Family support to enable parents and/or caregivers to anticipate decisions on walking aids, wheelchairs, feeding tubes, and other changing care needs. Surveillance: Brain MRI examination to monitor the status of demyelination using MLD brain MRI severity scoring with frequency per neurologist. Assess motor function and support needs using gross motor function measurement (GMFM). Monitor for disease exacerbations following febrile infections. At each visit, assess physical mobility, self-help skills, development, neurobehavioral and psychiatric issues, growth, nutrition, safety of oral intake, need for feeding support, constipation, respiratory issues, and family needs.

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics For this GeneReview, the term \\\"isolated methylmalonic acidemia\\\" refers to a group of inborn errors of metabolism associated with elevated methylmalonic acid (MMA) concentration in the blood and urine that result from the failure to isomerize (convert) methylmalonyl-coenzyme A (CoA) into succinyl-CoA during propionyl-CoA metabolism in the mitochondrial matrix, without hyperhomocysteinemia or homocystinuria, hypomethioninemia, or variations in other metabolites, such as malonic acid. Isolated MMA is caused by complete or partial deficiency of the enzyme methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (mut0 enzymatic subtype or mut enzymatic subtype, respectively), a defect in the transport or synthesis of its cofactor, 5-deoxy-adenosyl- cobalamin (cblA, cblB, or cblD-MMA), or deficiency of the enzyme methylmalonyl-CoA epimerase. Prior to the advent of newborn screening, common phenotypes included: Infantile/non-B12-responsive form (mut0 enzymatic subtype, cblB), the most common phenotype, associated with infantile-onset lethargy, tachypnea, hypothermia, vomiting, and dehydration on initiation of protein-containing feeds. Without appropriate treatment, the infantile/non-B12-responsive phenotype could rapidly progress to coma due to hyperammonemic encephalopathy. Partially deficient or B12-responsive phenotypes (mut enzymatic subtype, cblA, cblB [rare], cblD-MMA), in which symptoms occur in the first few months or years of life and are characterized by feeding problems, failure to thrive, hypotonia, and developmental delay marked by episodes of metabolic decompensation Methylmalonyl-CoA epimerase deficiency, in which findings range from complete absence of symptoms to severe metabolic acidosis. Affected individuals can also develop ataxia, dysarthria, hypotonia, mild spastic paraparesis, and seizures. In those individuals diagnosed by newborn screening and treated from an early age, there appears to be decreased early mortality, less severe symptoms at diagnosis, favorable short-term neurodevelopmental outcome, and lower incidence of movement disorders and irreversible cerebral damage.

GeneReviews impairment of renal function, \\\"metabolic stroke\\\" (bilateral lacunar infarction of the basal ganglia during acute metabolic decompensation), pancreatitis, growth failure, functional immune impairment, bone marrow failure, optic nerve atrophy, arrhythmias and/or cardiomyopathy (dilated or hypertrophic), liver steatosis/fibrosis/ cancer, and renal cancer. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of isolated MMA is established in a proband by identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in MCEE, MMAA, MMAB, MMADHC, or MMUT or (in some instances) by significantly reduced activity of one of the following enzymes: methylmalonyl-CoA mutase, methylmalonyl-CoA mutase enzyme cofactor 5'- deoxyadenosylcobalamin, or methylmalonyl-CoA epimerase. Because of its relatively high sensitivity, easier accessibility, and noninvasive nature, molecular genetic testing can obviate the need for enzymatic testing in most instances. Management Treatment of manifestations / Prevention of primary manifestations: When isolated MMA is suspected during the diagnostic evaluation due to elevated propionylcarnitine (C3) on a newborn blood spot, metabolic treatment should be initiated immediately, while the suspected diagnosis is being confirmed. Development and evaluation of treatment plans, training and education of affected individuals and their families, and avoidance of side effects of dietary treatment (i.e., malnutrition, growth failure) require a multidisciplinary approach by experienced subspecialists from a specialized metabolic center. The main principles of treatment are to provide supplemental vitamin B12 to those who are known to be vitamin B12 responsive; restrict natural protein, particularly of propiogenic amino acid precursors, while maintaining a high-calorie diet; address feeding difficulties, recurrent vomiting, and growth failure; provide supplemental carnitine to those with carnitine deficiency; reduce propionate production from gut flora; and provide emergency treatment during episodes of acute decompensation with the goal of averting catabolism and minimizing central nervous system injury. In those with significant metabolic instability and/or renal failure, liver and/or renal transplantation may be considered. Prevention of secondary complications: MedicAlert bracelets and up-to-date, easily accessed, detailed emergency treatment and presurgical protocols to facilitate care. Surveillance: Regular evaluations by a metabolic specialist and metabolic dietician; screening laboratory testing, including plasma amino acids, plasma and urine MMA levels, serum acylcarnitine profile and free and total carnitine levels, blood chemistries, and complete blood count at least every six months to one year, or more frequently in infants or in those who are unstable or require frequent changes in dietary management; measurement of renal function at least annually or as clinically indicated; assessment for liver disease at least annually or as clinically indicated; assessment of developmental progress and for signs of movement disorder at each visit; ophthalmology evaluation to monitor for optic atrophy at least annually or as clinically indicated; audiology evaluation at least annually in childhood and adolescence or as clinically indicated. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Fasting, stress, increased dietary protein, supplementation with the individual propiogenic amino acids valine and isoleucine, nephrotoxic medications or agents, and agents that prolong QTc in the EKG. Evaluation of relatives at risk: For at-risk newborn sibs when prenatal testing was not performed: in parallel with newborn screening, measure serum methylmalonic acid, urine organic acids, plasma acylcarnitine profile, plasma amino acids, and serum B12; test for the familial isolated methylmalonic acidemia-causing pathogenic variants if biochemistry is abnormal. Methylmalonic Acidemia 3 Pregnancy management for an affected mother: Monitor for complications including acute decompensation or hyperammonemia, deterioration of renal function, and obstetric complications including preeclampsia and preterm delivery. Pregnancy management for an unaffected mother with an affected fetus: Oral and intramuscular vitamin B12 has been administered to women pregnant with a fetus with vitamin B12-responsive MMA, resulting in decreased maternal MMA urine output; however, further study of this treatment is needed. Genetic counseling All forms of isolated MMA are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. If both parents are known to be heterozygous for an isolated MMA-causing pathogenic variant, each sib of an affected individual has at conception a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of inheriting neither of the familial pathogenic variants. Once the isolated MMA-causing pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member, molecular genetic carrier testing and prenatal/preimplantation genetic testing are possible."

Genetic counseling MCTT syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder typically caused by a de novo MN1 pathogenic variant. The risk to the sibs of a proband depends on the genetic status of the proband's parents: if the MN1 pathogenic variant found in the proband cannot be detected in the leukocyte DNA of either parent, the recurrence risk to sibs is estimated to be slightly greater than that of the general population because of the possibility of parental somatic/germline mosaicism.

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalopathy (MNGIE) disease is characterized by progressive gastrointestinal dysmotility (manifesting as early satiety, nausea, dysphagia, gastroesophageal reflux, postprandial emesis, episodic abdominal pain and/or distention, and diarrhea); cachexia; ptosis/ ophthalmoplegia or ophthalmoparesis; leukoencephalopathy; and demyelinating peripheral neuropathy (manifesting as paresthesias (tingling, numbness, and pain) and symmetric and distal weakness more prominently affecting the lower extremities). The order in which manifestations appear is unpredictable. Onset is usually between the first and fifth decades; in about 60% of individuals, symptoms begin before age 20 years. Diagnosis/testing The clinical diagnosis of MNGIE disease is based on the presence of severe gastrointestinal dysmotility, cachexia, ptosis, external ophthalmoplegia, sensorimotor neuropathy, asymptomatic leukoencephalopathy as observed on brain MRI, and family history consistent with autosomal recessive inheritance. The diagnosis of MNGIE disease can be established in a proband by detection of one of the following: (1) biallelic pathogenic variants in TYMP (formerly known as ECGF1); (2) markedly reduced levels of thymidine phosphorylase enzyme activity; or (3) elevated plasma concentrations of thymidine and deoxyuridine. Management Treatment of manifestations: Management is primarily supportive and includes attention to swallowing difficulties and airway protection; dromperidone for nausea and vomiting; gastrostomy, and parenteral feeding for nutritional support; antibiotics for intestinal bacterial overgrowth; amitriptyline, nortriptyline, and gabapentin for neuropathic symptoms; specialized schooling arrangements; and physical and occupational therapy.

Unless an individual with MNGIE disease has offspring with either an affected individual or a carrier, his/her offspring will be obligate heterozygotes for a pathogenic variant in TYMP. Carrier testing for at-risk family members and prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk are possible once the TYMP pathogenic variants in the family are known."

Other manifestations include coarse facies, pigmented skin lesions, cardiac defects, and corneal opacities. Onset is usually between ages six months and six years (range: birth to 11 years). Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of MONA is established in a proband with characteristic clinical and radiographic findings and either biallelic pathogenic variants in MMP2 or decreased activity of the enzyme matrix metalloproteinase 2. Management Treatment of manifestations: Treatment is supportive only and can include physical therapy (which may slow the rate of development of contractures and prolong mobility) and mobility aids. Pain medications may not provide relief unless the pain is due to secondary osteoarthritis/contractures. Daily recommended supplementation of vitamin D and calcium; standard management of congenital heart defects; management of scoliosis and kyphosis per orthopedist. Surveillance: Annual joint assessment by a rheumatologist or orthopedic surgeon. Evaluation with cardiologist as needed for follow up of congenital heart disease.

Clinical characteristics Familial monosomy 7 is characterized by early-childhood onset of bone marrow insufficiency/failure associated with increased risk for myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In all reported individuals, the monosomy 7 is believed to be an acquired cytogenetic abnormality within hematopoietic cells due to as-yet poorly defined inherited genetic predisposition. Identification of peripheral blood leukocytes with monosomy 7 usually precedes bone marrow failure/MDS/AML by a few months to years. Nearly all individuals reported with familial monosomy 7 have died of their disease. Note: Only a minority of individuals with bone marrow failure/MDS/AML with monosomy 7 have familial monosomy 7. Diagnosis/testing Detection of cells with monosomy 7 during evaluation of a hematologic abnormality or malignancy or in the context of chromosomal studies in the diagnosis of unrelated conditions needs to be confirmed with bone marrow cytogenetic and interphase FISH studies. A bone marrow karyotype of 45,XX,-7 in females or 45,XY,-7 in males, often mosaic with normal cells (i.e., 46,XX in females and 46,XY in males), confirms the presence of monosomy 7. Of note, individuals with a family history of monosomy 7 (e.g., an affected sib) may initially have a normal karyotype in peripheral blood and/or bone marrow and later transition to mosaic monosomy 7 in peripheral blood and/or bone marrow.

Management GeneReviews Treatment of manifestations: Urgent referral to an oncologist should be considered for individuals with monosomy 7 (mosaic or non-mosaic). Definitive therapy is bone marrow transplantation (BMT) prior to the emergence of a leukemic clone. The suitability of sibs who are potential bone marrow donors may be evaluated with appropriate hematologic and cytogenetic studies to rule out bone marrow disease associated with familial monosomy 7. However, given that the underlying germline pathogenic variant may not be known, a matched sib donor may not be an ideal candidate (unless much older than the affected individual and with no evidence of hematologic disorders). An unrelated donor may be more suitable. Prevention of secondary complications: It is unknown if the standard protocols for ablative therapy prior to BMT should be modified. Surveillance: Annual monitoring of peripheral blood karyotype, hematologic status, and hemoglobin F levels helps identify emerging bone marrow abnormalities (cytopenias and bone marrow dysplasia) prior to the development of overt AML or MDS. Evaluation of relatives at risk: In both children and adults with a family history of monosomy 7, otherwise unexplained signs and symptoms should be evaluated by a physician as possible early indications of the disorder. Genetic counseling The mode of inheritance of familial monosomy 7 is unknown."

Weakness of the neck flexors is seen in most affected individuals and mild facial weakness is often present. After distal weakness has been present for more than ten years, mild proximal weakness may be observed. Life expectancy is normal. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of Laing distal myopathy is established in a proband with suggestive findings and a heterozygous pathogenic variant in MYH7 identified by molecular genetic testing.

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics C3 glomerulopathy (C3G) is a complex ultra-rare complement-mediated renal disease caused by uncontrolled activation of the complement alternative pathway (AP) in the fluid phase (as opposed to cell surface) that is rarely inherited in a simple mendelian fashion. C3G affects individuals of all ages, with a median age at diagnosis of 23 years. Individuals with C3G typically present with hematuria, proteinuria, hematuria and proteinuria, acute nephritic syndrome or nephrotic syndrome, and low levels of the complement component C3. Spontaneous remission of C3G is uncommon, and about half of affected individuals develop end-stage renal disease (ESRD) within ten years of diagnosis, occasionally developing the late comorbidity of impaired visual acuity. Diagnosis/testing The definitive diagnosis of C3G requires a renal biopsy with specialized immunofluorescence and electron microscopy studies both for diagnosis and to distinguish between the two major subtypes of C3G: C3 glomerulonephritis (C3GN) and dense deposit disease (DDD). Some individuals will have biallelic or heterozygous pathogenic variants identified by molecular genetic testing in one or more of the genes that have been implicated in the pathogenesis of C3G (i.e., C3, CD46, CFB, CFH, CFHR1, CFHR5, CFI, and DGKE). Management Treatment of manifestations: Nonspecific therapies used to treat numerous chronic glomerular diseases, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II type-1 receptor blockers, and lipid-lowering agents (in particular hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors). Complement inhibition with a terminal pathway blocker may alter disease course in some individuals. When ESRD develops, treatment options are limited to dialysis or transplantation. C3G recurs in nearly all grafts and is the predominant cause of graft failure in 50%-90% of transplant recipients.

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics MPPH (megalencephaly-postaxial polydactyly-polymicrogyria-hydrocephalus) syndrome is a developmental brain disorder characterized by megalencephaly (brain overgrowth) with the cortical malformation bilateral perisylvian polymicrogyria (BPP). At birth the occipital frontal circumference (OFC) ranges from normal to 6 standard deviations (SD) above the mean for age, sex, and gestational age; in older individuals the range is from 3 to 10 SD above the mean. A variable degree of ventriculomegaly is seen in almost all children with MPPH syndrome; nearly 50% of individuals have frank hydrocephalus. Neurologic problems associated with BPP include oromotor dysfunction (100%), epilepsy (50%), and mild-to-severe intellectual disability (100%). Postaxial hexadactyly occurs in 50% of individuals with MPPH syndrome. Diagnosis/testing The clinical diagnosis of MPPH syndrome can be established in individuals with the two core features: megalencephaly and polymicrogyria (PMG). The molecular diagnosis of MPPH syndrome is established in a proband with some of the suggestive clinical and imaging features by identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in one of three genes: AKT3, CCND2, or PIK3R2. While most individuals with MPPH syndrome have a germline pathogenic variant in one of these genes, some have a somatic mosaic pathogenic variant (most commonly reported in PIK3R2 or AKT3). Management Treatment of manifestations: Hydrocephalus warrants early neurosurgical intervention. Treatment per neurooncologist for those with medulloblastoma. Oromotor difficulties, epilepsy, developmental delays, intellectual disability, polydactyly, vision issues, cardiac anomalies, thyroid abnormalities, and renal anomalies are treated as per usual clinical care standards. Social worker support and care coordination for families of affected individuals.

GeneReviews Surveillance: Follow up with a pediatric neurologist regularly to monitor and treat epilepsy. Brain MRI to detect hydrocephalus and/or cerebellar tonsillar ectopia is provisionally recommended every six months from birth to age two years, and yearly from age two to six years. In older individuals, the frequency should be determined based on prior brain imaging findings as well as clinical findings. Brain imaging (with particular attention to the posterior fossa) may be considered every six months to assess for medulloblastoma. Assess growth and feeding at each visit. Routine follow up with a developmental pediatrician given the high risk of developmental delays and/or intellectual disability. Ophthalmology examination annually or as needed; endocrine follow up as recommended by endocrinologist. Assess need for social work support and care coordination at each visit. Genetic counseling MPPH syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder typically caused by a de novo pathogenic variant. Almost all individuals with MPPH syndrome have the disorder as the result of a de novo germline AKT3, CCND2, or PIK3R2 pathogenic variant; somatic mosaic pathogenic variants in PIK3R2 and AKT3 have been reported in a few affected individuals. Vertical transmission of a PIK3R2 pathogenic variant from an affected heterozygous parent to several affected children has been reported in one family to date. Presumed parental germline mosaicism has been suggested in three families. Each child of an individual with a germline AKT3, CCND2, or PIK3R2 pathogenic variant has a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant. The risk for transmission to offspring of an individual with somatic mosaicism for an MPPH-related pathogenic variant is expected to be less than 50%. Once the MPPH syndrome-related pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing for MPPH syndrome are possible."

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I) is a progressive multisystem disorder with features ranging over a continuum of severity. While affected individuals have traditionally been classified as having one of three MPS I syndromes (Hurler syndrome, Hurler-Scheie syndrome, or Scheie syndrome), no easily measurable biochemical differences have been identified and the clinical findings overlap. Affected individuals are best described as having either a phenotype consistent with either severe (Hurler syndrome) or attenuated MPS I, a distinction that influences therapeutic options. Severe MPS I: Infants appear normal at birth. Typical early manifestations are nonspecific (e.g., umbilical or inguinal hernia, frequent upper respiratory tract infections before age 1 year). Coarsening of the facial features may not become apparent until after age one year. Gibbus deformity of the lower spine is common and often noted within the first year. Progressive skeletal dysplasia (dysostosis multiplex) involving all bones is universal, as is progressive arthropathy involving most joints. By age three years, linear growth decreases. Intellectual disability is progressive and profound but may not be readily apparent in the first year of life. Progressive cardiorespiratory involvement, hearing loss, and corneal clouding are common. Without treatment, death (typically from cardiorespiratory failure) usually occurs within the first ten years of life. Attenuated MPS I: Clinical onset is usually between ages three and ten years. The severity and rate of disease progression range from serious life-threatening complications leading to death in the second to third decade, to a normal life span complicated by significant disability from progressive joint manifestations and cardiorespiratory disease. While some individuals have no neurologic involvement and psychomotor development may be normal in early childhood, learning disabilities and psychiatric manifestations can be present later in life. Hearing loss, cardiac valvular disease, respiratory involvement, and corneal clouding are common.

GeneReviews is a registered trademark of the University of Washington, Seattle. All rights reserved. Diagnosis/testing GeneReviews The diagnosis of MPS I is established in a proband with suggestive clinical and laboratory findings by: detection of deficient activity of the lysosomal enzyme -L-iduronidase (IDUA) in combination with elevation of glycosaminoglycan levels; and/or identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in IDUA on molecular genetic testing. Identification of the causative IDUA variants plays an important role in the determination of phenotype. Management Treatment of manifestations: An essential component of management is the determination of whether the proband has severe or attenuated MPS I. This requires detailed clinical and laboratory assessment and can be challenging in very young individuals. Targeted therapies: Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is considered the standard of care for children with severe MPS I. Outcome is significantly influenced by disease burden at the time of diagnosis (and thus, by the age of the individual). HSCT can improve cognitive outcomes, increase survival, improve growth, reduce facial coarseness and hepatosplenomegaly, improve hearing, prevent hydrocephalus, and alter the natural history of cardiac and respiratory symptomatology. HSCT has lesser effects on the skeletal and joint manifestations, corneal clouding, and cardiac involvement. HSCT alters the course of cognitive decline in children with severe MPS I; cognitive outcome is greatly influenced by the degree of cognitive impairment at the time of transplantation. Due to the morbidity and mortality associated with HSCT, it is currently recommended primarily for children with severe MPS I. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with laronidase (Aldurazyme), licensed for treatment of the non-CNS manifestations of MPS I, improves liver size, linear growth, and mobility and joint range of motion; slows progression of respiratory disease; and improves sleep apnea in persons with attenuated disease. The age of initiation of ERT influences the outcome. Supportive care: Infant learning programs/special education for developmental delay; physical therapy, orthopedic surgery as needed, joint replacement for progressive arthropathy, atlanto-occipital stabilization; spinal cord decompression for cervical myelopathy; cerebrospinal fluid shunting for hydrocephalus; early median nerve decompression for carpal tunnel syndrome based on nerve conduction studies before clinical manifestations develop; special attention to anesthetic risks; hats with visors/sunglasses to reduce glare, corneal transplantation for ophthalmologic involvement; cardiac valve replacement as needed and bacterial endocarditis prophylaxis for those with cardiac involvement; tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy for eustachian tube dysfunction and/or upper airway obstruction; ventilating tubes; hearing aids as needed; CPAP for sleep apnea; gastrointestinal management for diarrhea and constipation. Surveillance: Annual assessment by a team of physicians with knowledge of the multisystem nature of MPS I. Specialists and assessments: orthopedic surgery including annual assessment of median nerve conduction velocity; ophthalmology, cardiology (including echocardiography), respiratory with assessment of pulmonary function and sleep studies, audiology, and otolaryngology. Assessment for constipation and/or hernias as needed. Early and continuous monitoring of head growth in infants and children with imaging as needed; assessment for evidence of spinal cord compression by neurologic examination; developmental assessment annually; and psycho-educational assessment of children with attenuated disease prior to primary school entry. Evaluation of relatives at risk: Early diagnosis prior to significant disease manifestations is warranted in relatives at risk in order to initiate therapy as early in the course of disease as possible. Type I 3 Genetic counseling MPS I is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. At conception, each child of a couple in which both parents are heterozygous for a IDUA pathogenic variant has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Carrier testing for at-risk relatives and prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk are possible if both disease-causing IDUA variants have been identified in the family."

Disease onset is typically before age ten years. Disease course may be rapidly or slowly progressive; some individuals with an extremely attenuated disease course present in mid-to-late adulthood with early-onset dementia with or without a history of ID. Systemic manifestations can include musculoskeletal problems (joint stiffness, contractures, scoliosis, and hip dysplasia), hearing loss, respiratory tract and sinopulmonary infections, and cardiac disease (valvular thickening, defects in the cardiac conduction system). Neurologic decline is seen in all affected individuals; however, clinical severity varies within and among the four MPS III subtypes (defined by the enzyme involved) and even among members of the same family. Death usually occurs in the second or third decade of life secondary to neurologic regression or respiratory tract infections. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of MPS III is established in a proband with suggestive clinical and laboratory findings in whom either biallelic pathogenic variants in one of four genes (GNS, HGSNAT, NAGLU, and SGSH) or deficiency of the respective lysosomal enzyme has been identified.

Children with MPS IVA typically have no distinctive clinical findings at birth. The severe form is usually apparent between ages one and three years, often first manifesting as kyphoscoliosis, genu valgum (knock-knee), and pectus carinatum; the slowly progressive form may not become evident until late childhood or adolescence, often first manifesting as hip problems (pain, stiffness, and Legg Perthes disease). Progressive bone and joint involvement leads to short stature, and eventually to disabling pain and arthritis. Involvement of other organ systems can lead to significant morbidity, including respiratory compromise, obstructive sleep apnea, valvular heart disease, hearing impairment, visual impairment from corneal clouding, dental abnormalities, and hepatomegaly. Compression of the spinal cord is a common complication that results in neurologic impairment. Children with MPS IVA have normal intellectual abilities at the outset of the disease. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of MPS IVA is established in a proband by identification of low N-acetylgalactosamine 6-sulfatase (GALNS) enzyme activity in cultured fibroblasts or leukocytes or by identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in GALNS on molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Enzyme replacement therapy (elosulfase alfa) is available, although the data on long-term effects of this treatment on the skeletal and non-skeletal features of MPS IVA are limited.

A later-onset neuromyopathic disease characterized by myopathy and neuropathy, and associated with multiple mtDNA deletions in muscle, has also rarely been described. MPV17-related mtDNA maintenance defect, encephalohepatopathic form is characterized by: Hepatic manifestations (liver dysfunction that typically progresses to liver failure, cholestasis, hepatomegaly, and steatosis); Neurologic involvement (developmental delay, hypotonia, microcephaly, and motor and sensory peripheral neuropathy); Gastrointestinal manifestations (gastrointestinal dysmotility, feeding difficulties, and failure to thrive); and Metabolic derangements (lactic acidosis and hypoglycemia). Less frequent manifestations include renal tubulopathy, nephrocalcinosis, and hypoparathyroidism. Progressive liver disease often leads to death in infancy or early childhood. Hepatocellular carcinoma has been reported.

Diagnosis/testing GeneReviews The diagnosis of MPV17-related mtDNA maintenance defect is established in a proband by the identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in MPV17 by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Ideally management is by a multidisciplinary team including specialists in hepatology, neurology, nutrition, clinical genetics, and child development. Nutritional support should be provided by a dietitian experienced in managing children with liver diseases; prevention of hypoglycemia requires frequent feeds and uncooked cornstarch (1-2 g/kg/dose). Although liver transplantation remains the only treatment option for liver failure, it is controversial because of the multisystem involvement in this disorder. Prevention of secondary complications: Prevent nutritional deficiencies (e.g., of fat-soluble vitamins) by ensuring adequate intake.

Additional features may include psychomotor delay, hypergonadotropic hypogonadism, short stature, and various skeletal abnormalities. Children with MSS usually present with muscular hypotonia in early infancy; distal and proximal muscular weakness is noticed during the first decade of life. Later, cerebellar findings of truncal ataxia, dysdiadochokinesia, nystagmus, and dysarthria become apparent. Motor function worsens progressively for some years, then stabilizes at an unpredictable age and degree of severity. Cataracts can develop rapidly and typically require lens extraction in the first decade of life. Although many adults have severe disabilities, life span in MSS appears to be near normal. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of MSS is established in an individual with typical clinical findings and/or biallelic pathogenic variants in SIL1 identified by molecular genetic testing. Electron microscopic ultrastructural changes on muscle biopsy are thought to be specific to MSS.

Clinical characteristics Myostatin-related muscle hypertrophy is characterized by reduced subcutaneous fat pad thickness and increased muscle size in individuals with normal or increased muscle strength. Both heterozygotes and homozygotes for a causative variant in MSTN encoding the protein growth differentiation factor 8 (myostatin) can exhibit muscle hypertrophy. Clinical manifestations depend on the amount of myostatin protein present. An infant homozygous for an MSTN causative variant had muscle mass twice that of sex- and age-matched controls; intellect and cardiac function were normal. He displayed stimulus-induced myoclonus that subsided after two months. Heterozygotes may have increased muscle bulk and strength, but to a lesser degree. Diagnosis/testing Skeletal muscle size in an individual with myostatin-related muscle hypertrophy is measured by ultrasound examination, DEXA, or MRI. Subcutaneous fat pad thickness is measured by ultrasound or with a caliper. MSTN is the only gene in which mutation is known to cause myostatin-related muscle hypertrophy.

Neonates with classic MSUD are born asymptomatic but without treatment follow a predictable course: 1224 hours. Elevated concentrations of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs; leucine, isoleucine, and valine) and alloisoleucine, as well as a generalized disturbance of amino acid concentration ratios, are present in blood and the maple syrup odor can be detected in cerumen; Two to three days. Early and nonspecific signs of metabolic intoxication (i.e., irritability, hypersomnolence, anorexia) are accompanied by the presence of branched-chain alpha-ketoacids, acetoacetate, and beta-hydroxybutyrate in urine; Four to six days. Worsening encephalopathy manifests as lethargy, apnea, opisthotonos, and reflexive \\\"fencing\\\" or \\\"bicycling\\\" movements as the sweet maple syrup odor becomes apparent in urine; Seven to ten days. Severe intoxication culminates in critical cerebral edema, coma, and central respiratory failure. Individuals with intermediate MSUD have partial branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase deficiency that manifests only intermittently or responds to dietary thiamine therapy; these individuals can experience severe metabolic intoxication and encephalopathy in the face of sufficient catabolic stress. In the era of newborn screening (NBS), the prompt initiation of treatment of asymptomatic infants detected by NBS means that most individuals who would have developed neonatal manifestations of MSUD remain asymptomatic with continued treatment adherence. Diagnosis/testing Suggestive biochemical findings on NBS include whole-blood concentration ratios of (leucine + isoleucine) to alanine and phenylalanine that are above the cutoff values for the particular screening lab.

GeneReviews amino acid analysis typically demonstrates elevated concentrations of BCAAs and alloisoleucine. The diagnosis of MSUD is confirmed by identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in BCKDHA, BCKDHB, or DBT. Management Treatment of manifestations: Treatment consists of dietary leucine restriction, BCAA-free medical foods, judicious supplementation with isoleucine and valine, and frequent clinical and biochemical monitoring. A BCAA-restricted diet fortified with prescription medical foods can maintain average plasma BCAA concentrations within standard reference intervals and preserves the ratios among them. Use of a \\\"sick-day\\\" formula recipe (devoid of leucine and enriched with calories, isoleucine, valine, and BCAA-free amino acids) combined with rapid and frequent amino acid monitoring allows many catabolic illnesses to be managed in the outpatient setting. Acute metabolic decompensation is corrected by treating the precipitating stress while delivering sufficient calories, insulin, free amino acids, isoleucine, and valine to achieve sustained net protein synthesis in tissues. Some centers use hemodialysis/hemofiltration to remove BCAAs from the extracellular compartment, but this intervention does not alone establish net protein accretion. Brain edema is a common complication of metabolic encephalopathy and requires careful management in an intensive care setting. Adolescents and adults with MSUD are at increased risk for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, depression, and anxiety disorders and can be treated successfully with standard psychostimulant and antidepressant medications. Prevention of primary manifestations: Transplantation of allogeneic liver tissue affords affected individuals an unrestricted diet and protects them from metabolic crises, but does not reverse preexisting psychomotor disability or mental illness. In those who have not undergone liver transplantation, strict and consistent metabolic control can decrease the risk of developing neuropsychiatric morbidities. Consider a trial of enteral thiamine to determine if an affected individual may have thiamine-responsive disease. Prevention of secondary complications: Any trauma care or surgical procedures should be approached in consultation with a metabolic specialist. Surveillance: Weekly or twice-weekly assessment of amino acid profile for rapidly growing infants; weekly amino acid profile assessment in children, adolescents, and adults; routine monitoring of calcium, magnesium, zinc, folate, selenium, and omega-3 essential fatty acid levels; at least monthly visit with a metabolic specialist in infancy; assessment of developmental milestones at each visit or as needed. Evaluation of relatives at risk: It can be determined if newborn sibs of an affected individual (who have not been tested prenatally) are affected (1) by plasma amino acid analysis at approximately 24 hours of life; or (2) by molecular genetic testing of umbilical cord blood if the family-specific pathogenic variants have been identified. Early diagnosis may allow management of asymptomatic infants out of hospital by experienced providers. Before confirmatory molecular testing is complete, at-risk neonates can be managed with an MSUD prescription diet if serial plasma amino acid profiles provide evidence of MSUD. Pregnancy management: For women with MSUD, metabolic control should be rigorously maintained before and throughout pregnancy by frequent monitoring of plasma amino acid concentrations and dietary adjustments to avoid the likely teratogenic effects of elevated maternal leucine plasma concentration. Fetal growth should be monitored to detect any signs of essential amino acid deficiency. The catabolic stress of labor, involutional changes of the uterus, and internal sequestration of blood are potential sources of metabolic decompensation of the affected mother. Appropriate monitoring of the affected mother at a metabolic referral center at the time of delivery and in the postpartum period are recommended. Syrup Urine Disease 3 Genetic counseling MSUD is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. At conception, each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being unaffected and a carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier.

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Enlarged parietal foramina are characteristic symmetric, paired radiolucencies of the parietal bones, located close to the intersection of the sagittal and lambdoid sutures, caused by deficient ossification around the parietal notch, which is normally obliterated by the fifth month of fetal development. Enlarged parietal foramina are usually asymptomatic. Meningeal, cortical, and vascular malformations of the posterior fossa occasionally accompany the bone defects and may predispose to epilepsy. In a minority of individuals, headaches, vomiting, or intense local pain are sometimes associated with the defects, especially on application of mild pressure to the unprotected cerebral cortex. Diagnosis/testing Typically oval or round, enlarged parietal foramina resemble a \\\"pair of spectacles\\\" on postero-anterior skull radiographs. They may be less apparent on lateral skull radiographs because the lucencies are projected obliquely through normal bone. In young children, the disorder may present as a persistently enlarged posterior fontanelle caused by a single large central parietal bone defect (cranium bifidum). 3D CT scanning using bone windows clearly reveals the defect. MRI is useful in defining associated intracranial anatomic changes. Heterozygous pathogenic variants in either ALX4 or MSX2 are established causes. Management Treatment of manifestations: Treatment is generally conservative. Persistent cranium bifidum may warrant operative closure. Associated headaches or seizures should be treated appropriately. The risk for penetrating injury to the brain is small but may cause anxiety; education of parents, teachers, and the affected child to avoid risky behaviors that could result in injury suffices in most circumstances.

Pathogenic variants in MT-RNR1 can be associated with predisposition to aminoglycoside ototoxicity and/or late-onset SNHL. Hearing loss associated with aminoglycoside ototoxicity is bilateral and severe to profound, occurring within a few days to weeks after administration of any amount (even a single dose) of an aminoglycoside antibiotic such as gentamycin, tobramycin, amikacin, kanamycin, or streptomycin. Pathogenic variants in MT-TS1 are usually associated with childhood onset of SNHL that is generally nonsyndromic although the MT-TS1 substitution m.7445A>G has been found in some families who also have palmoplantar keratoderma (scaling, hyperkeratosis, and honeycomb appearance of the skin of the palms, soles, and heels).

Evaluation of relatives at risk: Molecular genetic testing of at-risk maternal relatives allows for early detection of those who have inherited the mtDNA pathogenic variant and would benefit from avoiding aminoglycosides and appropriate early support and management. Genetic counseling Mitochondrial nonsyndromic hearing loss and deafness is caused by pathogenic variants in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and is transmitted by maternal inheritance. The mother of a proband (usually) has the mtDNA pathogenic variant and may or may not have hearing loss. All offspring of females with a mtDNA pathogenic variant are at risk of inheriting the pathogenic variant. Offspring of males with a mtDNA pathogenic variant are not at risk of inheriting the pathogenic variant. Prenatal diagnosis for pregnancies at increased risk is possible if the mtDNA pathogenic variant in the family is known. Because of mitotic segregation, the mtDNA pathogenic variant load in amniocytes and chorionic villi is unlikely to correspond to that of other fetal or adult tissues. Furthermore, the presence of the mtDNA pathogenic variant does not predict the age of onset or severity of hearing loss."

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics X-linked myotubular myopathy (X-MTM), also known as myotubular myopathy (MTM), is characterized by muscle weakness that ranges from severe to mild. Approximately 80% of affected males present with severe (classic) X-MTM characterized by polyhydramnios, decreased fetal movement, and neonatal weakness, hypotonia, and respiratory failure. Motor milestones are significantly delayed and most individuals fail to achieve independent ambulation. Weakness is profound and often involves facial and extraocular muscles. Respiratory failure is nearly uniform, with most individuals requiring 24-hour ventilatory assistance. It is estimated that at least 25% of boys with severe X-MTM die in the first year of life, and those who survive rarely live into adulthood. Males with mild or moderate X-MTM (~20%) achieve motor milestones more quickly than males with the severe form; many ambulate independently, and may live into adulthood. Most require gastrostomy tubes and/or ventilator support. In all subtypes of X-MTM, the muscle disease is not obviously progressive. Female carriers of X-MTM are generally asymptomatic, although manifesting heterozygotes are increasingly being identified. In affected females, symptoms range from severe, generalized weakness presenting in childhood, with infantile onset similar to affected male patients, to mild (often asymmetric) weakness manifesting in adulthood. Affected adult females may experience progressive respiratory decline and ultimately require ventilatory support.

Management GeneReviews Treatment of manifestations: Treatment is supportive. Management optimally involves a team of specialists with expertise in the long-term care of children and/or adults with neuromuscular disorders, often including a pulmonologist, neurologist, physical therapist and/or rehabilitation medicine specialist, and clinical geneticist. Tracheostomy, G-tube feeding, and assistive communication devices are often required. Ophthalmologists, orthopedists, and orthodontists should address specific medical complications related to the underlying myopathy. Surveillance: Annual pulmonary assessment; polysomnography every one to three years; routine examination for scoliosis; annual ophthalmologic examinations to evaluate for ophthalmoplegia, ptosis, and myopia; routine assessment for dental malocclusion. Genetic counseling X-MTM is inherited in an X-linked manner. The risk to sibs of a male proband depends on the carrier status of the mother. If the mother is a carrier, each sib has a 50% chance of inheriting the MTM1 pathogenic variant. Males who inherit the variant will be affected; females who inherit the variant will be carriers and will generally not be affected. To date, there are no reported males with incomplete penetrance. In simplex cases (i.e., a single occurrence in a family), there is a probability of 80%-90% that a woman is a carrier if her son has a confirmed MTM1 pathogenic variant. Thus, about 10%-20% of males who represent simplex cases have a de novo pathogenic variant in MTM1 and a mother who is not a carrier. Germline mosaicism has been reported. Carrier testing of at-risk female relatives and prenatal testing for a pregnancy at risk are possible if the MTM1 pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected male relative."

Bilateral coronal synostosis typically results in brachycephaly, although turribrachycephaly (a \\\"tower-shaped\\\" skull) or a cloverleaf skull can be observed. Unilateral coronal synostosis results in anterior plagiocephaly. Other craniofacial findings typically include temporal bossing, widely spaced eyes, ptosis or mild proptosis, mild midface retrusion, and highly arched palate or cleft lip and palate. Strabismus is common. Other findings can include hearing loss, developmental delay, intellectual disability, behavioral issues, intracranial anomalies, epilepsy, ocular anomalies, brachydactyly, carpal and/or tarsal bone fusions, broad thumbs and great toes, clinodactyly, and radiographic findings of short and broad middle phalanges and/or cone-shaped epiphyses.

Once the FGFR3 p.Pro250Arg pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing for Muenke syndrome are possible."

Most affected individuals have moderate-to-severe intellectual disability. Speech is typically limited to a few words or is absent, with relative preservation of receptive language skills. Growth restriction with microcephaly and seizure disorder are also common. Most affected people have a happy demeanor and a wide-based gait that can sometimes be confused with Angelman syndrome. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of MWS is established in a proband with classic dysmorphic facial features and developmental delay / intellectual disability and/or a heterozygous pathogenic variant in ZEB2 identified by molecular genetic testing.

Genetic counseling MWS is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by a pathogenic variant in ZEB2, a heterozygous deletion of 2q22.3 involving ZEB2, or (rarely) a chromosome rearrangement that disrupts ZEB2. Almost all individuals reported to date have been simplex cases (i.e., a single occurrence in a family) resulting from a de novo genetic alteration; rarely, recurrence in a family has been reported when a parent has a low level of somatic or presumed germline mosaicism for a MWS-causing pathogenic variant. Individuals with MWS are not known to reproduce. Once the causative genetic alteration has been identified in the proband, prenatal testing may be offered to parents of a child with MWS because of the recurrence risk associated with the possibility of parental mosaicism or a balanced chromosome rearrangement."

Most affected individuals develop one or more additional extrahematologic manifestations of the disease over their lifetime, including sensorineural hearing loss, renal disease (manifesting initially as glomerular nephropathy), presenile cataracts, and/or elevation of liver enzymes. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of MYH9-related disease is established in a proband with suggestive findings and a heterozygous pathogenic variant in MYH9 identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: For most active hemorrhages, consider local measures as the first-line treatment; transfusion of platelet concentrates should be used for active hemorrhages that cannot be otherwise managed, life- or organ-threatening hemorrhages, and/or bleeding at critical sites. Whenever necessary, eltrombopag or platelet transfusion should be used to prepare affected individuals for elective surgery. Antifibrinolytic agents and desmopressin are also used for covering hemostatic challenges or treating hemorrhages. Hearing loss, renal complications, and cataracts are managed in a standard fashion; individuals with severe/profound deafness benefit from cochlear implantation.

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Myhre syndrome is a multisystem connective tissue disorder involving the skin and the cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, and musculoskeletal systems. Affected individuals may experience progressive and proliferative fibrosis. Fibrosis may occur spontaneously or following trauma, invasive medical procedures, or surgery, often resulting in significant complications. Characteristic facial features are found in almost all affected individuals and are more apparent in older children and adults. Cardiovascular issues can include aortic hypoplasia and stenosis, congenital heart defects, pericardial involvement, and restrictive cardiomyopathy. Joint limitations may progress with age and resemble mild joint contractures. Most individuals have developmental delay / cognitive impairment, typically in the mild-to-moderate range. Other findings may include autism spectrum disorder, conductive or mixed hearing loss, short stature, refractive errors, premature puberty, recurrent respiratory infections, mechanical respiratory issues (choanal stenosis, laryngeal narrowing), and stenosis of the upper gastrointestinal tract. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of Myhre syndrome is established in a proband with characteristic clinical findings and a heterozygous pathogenic (or likely pathogenic) variant in SMAD4 detected by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Feeding therapy with a low threshold for a clinical and/or radiographic swallowing study; referral to nutrition for poor weight gain or obesity; medical therapy for systemic and/or pulmonary hypertension; long-term tracheostomy may be required for those with complete or recurrent tracheal stenosis; aggressive medical management for constipation; physical therapy to keep joints mobile; hearing aids may be Author Affiliations: 1 MassGeneral Hospital for Children, Boston, Massachusetts; Email: lin.angela@mgh.harvard.edu; Email: lindsay.mark@mgh.harvard.edu. 2 Department of Translational Medicine, University of Naples \\\"Federico II\\\", Naples, Italy; Email: brunetti@tigem.it. 3 Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota; Email: schimmenti.lisa@mayo.edu. 4 University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska; Email: lstarr@unmc.edu.

Note: Growth hormone therapy for short stature is not currently recommended for individuals with Myhre syndrome. Prevention of secondary complications: Limiting tissue trauma appears to be the single most important preventive measure: the literature suggests increased risk of proliferative fibrosis following otherwise uncomplicated endotracheal intubation and surgical procedures. When possible, alternative noninvasive approaches should be pursued during diagnosis and management. Surveillance: At each visit: measure growth parameters, blood pressure, and oxygen pulse oximetry; monitor for respiratory insufficiency, signs/symptoms of upper-airway stenosis, constipation, developmental issues, behavioral issues, physical skills and mobility issues, premature puberty (in children), and frequent and/or unusual infections. Annually: perform pulmonary function studies (in children age >6 years who are able to cooperate), ophthalmology evaluation, and audiology evaluation. In asymptomatic individuals with a normal echocardiogram, repeat the echocardiogram every one to three years. Starting in the second decade: low threshold for fasting blood sugar and hemoglobin A1c to assess for diabetes; periodic DXA scan to monitor bone mineral density; monitor females with the c.1486C>T (p.Arg496Cys) pathogenic variant for menstrual irregularities. Genetic counseling Myhre syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Most probands with Myhre syndrome have the disorder as a result of a de novo SMAD4 pathogenic variant; however, vertical transmission from a parent to child has been rarely observed. If the SMAD4 pathogenic variant found in the proband cannot be detected in the leukocyte DNA of either parent, the risk to sibs is presumed to be slightly greater than that of the general population (though still <1%) because of the theoretic possibility of parental germline mosaicism. Once the SMAD4 pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at theoretic increased risk for Myhre syndrome and preimplantation genetic testing are possible."

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics SGCE myoclonus-dystonia (SGCE-M-D) is a movement disorder characterized by a combination of rapid, brief muscle contractions (myoclonus) and/or sustained twisting and repetitive movements that result in abnormal postures (dystonia). The myoclonic jerks typical of SGCE-M-D most often affect the neck, trunk, and upper limbs with less common involvement of the legs. Approximately 50% of affected individuals have additional focal or segmental dystonia, presenting as cervical dystonia and/or writer's cramp. Non-motor features may include alcohol abuse, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and anxiety disorders. Symptom onset is usually in the first decade of life and almost always by age 20 years, but ranges from age six months to 80 years. Most affected adults report a dramatic reduction in myoclonus in response to alcohol ingestion. SGCE-M-D is compatible with an active life of normal span. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of SGCE-M-D is established in a proband with characteristic clinical features by identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in SGCE. Management Treatment of manifestations: Class 1 evidence supports the improvement of myoclonus and dystonia with zonisamide. Benzodiazepines (particularly clonazepam) and anti-seizure drugs used to treat myoclonus (especially valproate and levitiracetam) also improve myoclonus in individuals with myoclonus-dystonia. The response to other anti-seizure drugs (e.g., topiramate) is more variable. Anticholinergic medication may improve dystonia. Botulinum toxin injection may be especially helpful for cervical dystonia. Improvement with L-5- hydroxytryptophan, L-dopa, and the salt of sodium oxybate has been reported. Deep brain stimulation has improved both myoclonus and dystonia, with most targeting the globus pallidus interna (GPi); however, success with ventral intermediate nucleus of the thalamus (VIM) target has also been reported.

GeneReviews Other: Symptoms of SGCE-M-D often improve short term with ingestion of alcohol, but the risk of addiction recommends against its long-term use. Genetic counseling SGCE-M-D is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner with penetrance determined by the parental origin of the altered SGCE allele: an SGCE pathogenic variant on the paternally derived (expressed) SGCE allele generally results in disease; a pathogenic variant on the maternally derived (silenced) SGCE allele typically does not result in disease. Most individuals with SGCE-M-D inherited the disorder from a heterozygous parent who may or may not have clinical signs of M-D (as phenotypic expression in the parent would depend on the sex of the transmitting grandparent). Each child of an individual with SGCE-M-D has a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant. Almost all children who inherit an SGCE pathogenic variant from their father develop symptoms, whereas only ~5% of children who inherit an SGCE pathogenic variant from their mother develop symptoms. Once the SGCE pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing and preimplantation genetic diagnosis are possible."

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Myotonia congenita is characterized by muscle stiffness present from childhood; all striated muscle groups including the extrinsic eye muscles, facial muscles, and tongue may be involved. Stiffness is relieved by repeated contractions of the muscle (the \\\"warm-up\\\" phenomenon). Muscles are usually hypertrophic. Whereas autosomal recessive (AR) myotonia congenita is often associated with more severe manifestations (such as progressive minor distal weakness and attacks of transient weakness brought on by movement after rest), autosomal dominant (AD) myotonia congenita is not. The age of onset varies: in AD myotonia congenita onset is usually in infancy or early childhood; in AR myotonia congenita the average age of onset is slightly older. In both AR and AD myotonia congenita onset may be as late as the third or fourth decade of life. Diagnosis/testing The molecular diagnosis of myotonia congenita is established in a proband with suggestive findings of myotonia and sometimes muscle hypertrophy, and either a heterozygous CLCN1 pathogenic variant or biallelic CLCN1 pathogenic variants identified on molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Muscle stiffness may respond to sodium channel blockers such as mexiletine (currently the medication with best documented effect), lamotrigine carbamazepine, or phenytoin. Beneficial effects have also been reported with quinine, dantrolene, and acetazolamide. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Depolarizing muscle relaxants (e.g., suxamethonium), adrenaline, beta-adrenergic agonists, and propranolol may aggravate myotonia.

GeneReviews Evaluation of relatives at risk: Because individuals with myotonia congenita may be at increased risk for adverse anesthesia-related events, molecular genetic testing of at-risk family members (for the CLCN1 pathogenic variant[s] identified in the proband) during childhood is appropriate. Genetic counseling Myotonia congenita is inherited in either an autosomal recessive (Becker disease) or an autosomal dominant (Thomsen disease) manner; the same pathogenic variant may be associated with both autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive inheritance. Establishing the mode of inheritance in a simplex case (i.e., a single occurrence in a family) may not be possible unless molecular genetic testing reveals two CLCN1 pathogenic variants in trans in a proband with unaffected parents, in which case inheritance can be assumed to be autosomal recessive. Autosomal recessive inheritance: If both parents are known to be heterozygous for a CLCN1 pathogenic variant, each sib of an affected individual has at conception a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being heterozygous, and a 25% chance of inheriting neither of the familial pathogenic variants. Autosomal dominant inheritance: The majority of individuals diagnosed with autosomal dominant myotonia congenita have an affected parent. The proportion of individuals with myotonia congenita caused by a de novo pathogenic variant is unknown but is presumably very low. If a parent of the proband is affected and/or is known to have the pathogenic variant identified in the proband, the risk to the sibs of inheriting the pathogenic variant is 50%. Once the CLCN1 pathogenic variant(s) have been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible."

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is a multisystem disorder that affects skeletal and smooth muscle as well as the eye, heart, endocrine system, and central nervous system. The clinical findings, which span a continuum from mild to severe, have been categorized into three somewhat overlapping phenotypes: mild, classic, and congenital. Mild DM1 is characterized by cataract and mild myotonia (sustained muscle contraction); life span is normal. Classic DM1 is characterized by muscle weakness and wasting, myotonia, cataract, and often cardiac conduction abnormalities; adults may become physically disabled and may have a shortened life span. Congenital DM1 is characterized by hypotonia and severe generalized weakness at birth, often with respiratory insufficiency and early death; intellectual disability is common. Diagnosis/testing DM1 is caused by expansion of a CTG trinucleotide repeat in the noncoding region of DMPK. The diagnosis of DM1 is suspected in individuals with characteristic muscle weakness and is confirmed by molecular genetic testing of DMPK. CTG repeat length exceeding 34 repeats is abnormal. Molecular genetic testing detects pathogenic variants in nearly 100% of affected individuals. Management Treatment of manifestations: Use of ankle-foot orthoses, wheelchairs, or other assistive devices; special education support for affected children; treatment of hypothyroidism; management of pain; consultation with a cardiologist for symptoms or EKG evidence of arrhythmia; removal of cataracts if vision is impaired; hormone replacement therapy for males with hypogonadism; surgical excision of pilomatrixoma and basal cell carcinomas.

Evaluation of relatives at risk: Molecular genetic testing for early diagnosis of relatives at risk to allow treatment of cardiac manifestations, diabetes mellitus, and cataracts. Genetic counseling DM1 is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Offspring of an affected individual have a 50% chance of inheriting the expanded allele. Pathogenic alleles may expand in length during gametogenesis, resulting in the transmission of longer trinucleotide repeat alleles that may be associated with earlier onset and more severe disease than that observed in the parent. Prenatal testing and preimplantation genetic testing are possible when the diagnosis of DM1 has been confirmed by molecular genetic testing in an affected family member."

While myotonia (involuntary muscle contraction with delayed relaxation) has been reported during the first decade, onset is typically in the third to fourth decade, most commonly with fluctuating or episodic muscle pain that can be debilitating and proximal and axial weakness of the neck flexors and the hip flexors. Subsequently, weakness occurs in the elbow extensors and finger flexors. Facial weakness and weakness of the ankle dorsiflexors are less common. Myotonia rarely causes severe symptoms. In a subset of individuals, calf hypertrophy in combination with brisk reflexes is notable. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of DM2 is established in a proband by identification of a heterozygous pathogenic expansion of a CCTG repeat within a complex repeat motif, (TG)n(TCTG)n(CCTG)n in CNBP. The number of CCTG repeats in a pathogenic expansion ranges from approximately 75 to more than 11,000, with a mean of approximately 5,000 repeats.

For those with renal anomalies: measurement of blood pressure at each visit and renal function tests annually or as clinically indicated. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Avoidance of medications that impair kidney function, in those with renal aplasia (solitary kidney) and/or known impaired kidney function. Evaluation of relatives at risk: It is appropriate to clarify the genetic status of apparently asymptomatic older and younger at-risk relatives of an affected individual in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from more in-depth evaluation for occult congenital malformations. Genetic counseling CNDD is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. If both parents are known to be heterozygous for a CNDD-related pathogenic variant, each sib of an affected individual has at conception a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Once the CNDD-related pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member, carrier testing for at-risk relatives and prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing are possible."

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Nail-patella syndrome (NPS) (previously referred to as Fong's disease), encompasses the classic clinical tetrad of changes in the nails, knees, and elbows, and the presence of iliac horns. Nail changes are the most constant feature of NPS. Nails may be absent, hypoplastic, or dystrophic; ridged longitudinally or horizontally; pitted; discolored; separated into two halves by a longitudinal cleft or ridge of skin; and thin or (less often) thickened. The patellae may be small, irregularly shaped, or absent. Elbow abnormalities may include limitation of extension, pronation, and supination; cubitus valgus; and antecubital pterygia. Iliac horns are bilateral, conical, bony processes that project posteriorly and laterally from the central part of the iliac bones of the pelvis. Renal involvement, first manifest as proteinuria with or without hematuria, occurs in 30%-50% of affected individuals; end-stage kidney disease occurs up to 15% of affected individuals. Primary open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension occur at increased frequency and at a younger age than in the general population. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of nail-patella syndrome is established in a proband with suggestive findings and/or a heterozygous pathogenic variant in LMX1B identified by molecular genetic testing Management Treatment of manifestations: Orthopedic problems may be helped by analgesics, physiotherapy, splinting, bracing, or surgery; MRI of joints to identify abnormal anatomy is important prior to surgery so that appropriate surgical treatment can be planned in advance; ACE inhibitors to control blood pressure and possibly to slow progression of proteinuria; kidney transplantation as needed; standard treatment for decreased bone mineral density, hypertension, constipation/inflammatory bowel disease, glaucoma, epilepsy, and dental anomalies.

Dental examination at least every six months and DXA scan as needed. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Chronic use of NSAIDs because of the detrimental effect on kidney function. Pregnancy management: The risk of developing preeclampsia may be increased in pregnant women with NPS; hence, frequent urinalysis and blood pressure measurement is recommended during pregnancy. For women taking an ACE inhibitor, transitioning to an alternative treatment ideally prior to pregnancy, or at least as soon as pregnancy is recognized, is recommended to avoid potential adverse effects of ACE inhibitors on the developing fetus. Genetic counseling Nail-patella syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Eighty-eight percent of individuals with NPS have an affected parent; 12% of affected individuals have a de novo pathogenic variant. The offspring of an affected individual are at a 50% risk of inheriting NPS. Prenatal testing and preimplantation genetic testing are possible if the pathogenic variant in the family has been identified."

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Mitochondrial DNA-associated Leigh syndrome spectrum (mtDNA-LSS) is part of a continuum of progressive neurodegenerative disorders caused by abnormalities of mitochondrial energy generation, which includes the overlapping phenotypes mtDNA-associated Leigh syndrome and mtDNA-associated Leigh-like syndrome. Mitochondrial DNA-LSS is characterized by onset of manifestations typically between ages three and 12 months, often following an intercurrent illness (usually viral) or metabolic challenge (vaccinations, surgery, prolonged fasting). Decompensation (often with elevated lactate levels in blood and/or cerebrospinal fluid) is typically associated with developmental delay and/or regression. Neurologic features include hypotonia, spasticity, seizures, movement disorders, cerebellar ataxia, and peripheral neuropathy. Brain stem dysfunction may manifest with respiratory symptoms, swallowing difficulties, ophthalmoparesis, and abnormalities in thermoregulation. Extraneurologic manifestations may include poor weight gain, cardiomyopathy, and conduction defects. Up to 50% of individuals die by age three years, most often from respiratory or cardiac failure. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of mtDNA-LSS is established in a proband fulfilling clinical diagnostic criteria for LSS by identification of a heteroplasmic or homoplasmic pathogenic variant in one of the 15 mtDNA genes known to be involved in mtDNA-LSS.

Management GeneReviews Treatment of manifestations: Treatment is supportive. Sodium bicarbonate or sodium citrate for significant acidosis (THAM may be used if there is hypernatraemia); anti-seizure medication for seizures; dystonia therapy with benzhexol, baclofen, tetrabenazine, or gabapentin alone or in combination, or by botulinum toxin injection; treatment of respiratory compromise per pulmonologist; caloric and nutritional supplementation and feeding therapy as needed; developmental and educational support; physical therapy and occupational therapy; standard treatment of eye movement disorders; medical management of cardiomyopathy; treatment of constipation as needed; treatment of liver failure per hepatologist; treatment of electrolyte abnormalities per nephrologist; hearing aids or cochlear implants for sensorineural hearing loss; speech therapy and hearing support services as needed; management of diabetes mellitus and adrenal insufficiency per endocrinologist; standard treatments for anxiety and/or depression; psychological support and care coordination for the affected individual and family. Surveillance: Affected individuals should be followed at regular intervals to monitor for progression of disease and associated complications. Neurologic assessment for ataxia and seizures at each visit along with an assessment of pulmonary issues, growth, nutrition, and gastrointestinal manifestations. Development, educational, and cognitive assessment and assessment of mobility and self-help skills at least annually. Ophthalmology assessment every six to 12 months or as advised by ophthalmologist. Annual blood pressure, EKG, and echocardiogram or as advised by cardiologist. Liver function tests, urinalysis, urine albumin-to- creatinine ratio, urine amino acids, serum electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, complete blood count, and fasting glucose annually. Annual audiology assessment. Assessment of care coordination and family psychosocial needs at each visit. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Sodium valproate, medications that cause acidosis, and dichloroacetate should be avoided or used with caution; administration of anesthesia requires careful consideration to avoid aggravation of respiratory symptoms and precipitation of respiratory failure. Genetic counseling Mitochondrial DNA-LSS is transmitted by maternal inheritance. The mother of a proband may have the mtDNA pathogenic variant and may exhibit mild clinical manifestations of mtDNA-LSS. Many affected individuals have no known family history of mtDNA-LSS or other mitochondrial disorder. The explanation for apparently simplex cases may be absence of a comprehensive and/or reliable family history, a maternal heteroplasmy level below the disease threshold (i.e., the minimum level of heteroplasmy expected to result in mitochondrial disease), or a de novo mtDNA pathogenic variant in the proband. If the mother of the proband has the mtDNA pathogenic variant identified in the proband, all sibs of the proband are at risk of inheriting the pathogenic variant. Sibs may inherit the pathogenic variant at varying heteroplasmy levels due to the bottleneck effect and variant-specific segregation patterns. The risk to a sib of developing clinical manifestations is difficult to determine and depends on heteroplasmy level, the variation in heteroplasmy levels among different tissues, and the disease threshold for the specific variant. Recurrence risk assessment and prenatal testing for disorders caused by pathogenic variants in mtDNA is challenging due to the intricacies of mtDNA transmission and the inherent challenge in using prenatal genetic test results to predict clinical outcome. Reproductive options for the family members of a proband with an mtDNA pathogenic variant may include prenatal testing, preimplantation genetic testing, and oocyte donation."

Seizures are of various types and can be difficult to manage. Developmental delay / intellectual disability (ID) is severe in nearly a half, moderate in a third, and mild in the remainder. Nearly a third never develop speech or language skills. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of NCBRS is established in a proband with suggestive clinical findings and the identification of a heterozygous SMARCA2 pathogenic variant by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Anti-seizure medication (ASM) for seizures under the care of a neurologist or epileptologist; occupational, physical, and/or speech therapy; routine management of refractive errors and hearing loss. Surveillance: At least yearly evaluation by a neurologist to assess for and/or manage seizures; yearly evaluation by a developmental pediatrician to assess developmental progress and therapeutic and educational interventions; regular follow up of ophthalmologic and/or audiologic abnormalities. Genetic counseling NCBRS is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. All affected individuals reported to date have NCBRS as the result of a de novo SMARCA2 pathogenic variant. Although no affected sibs have been reported, the risk to sibs is presumed to be greater than in the general population because of the possibility of germline mosaicism in a parent.

Clinical characteristics The neuronal ceroid-lipofuscinoses (NCLs) are a group of inherited, neurodegenerative, lysosomal storage disorders characterized by progressive intellectual and motor deterioration, seizures, and early death. Visual loss is a feature of most forms. Clinical phenotypes have been characterized traditionally according to the age of onset and order of appearance of clinical features into infantile, late-infantile, juvenile, adult, and Northern epilepsy (also known as progressive epilepsy with mental retardation [EPMR]). There is however genetic and allelic heterogeneity; a proposed new nomenclature and classification system has been developed to take into account both the responsible gene and the age at disease onset; for example, CLN1 disease, infantile onset and CLN1 disease, juvenile onset are both caused by pathogenic variants in PPT1 but with differing age of onset. The most prevalent NCLs are CLN3 disease, classic juvenile and CLN2 disease, classic late infantile (although prevalence varies by ethnicity and country of family origin): CLN2 disease, classic late infantile. The first symptoms typically appear between age two and four years, usually starting with epilepsy, followed by regression of developmental milestones, myoclonic ataxia, and pyramidal signs. Visual impairment typically appears at age four to six years and rapidly progresses to light /dark awareness only. Life expectancy ranges from age six years to early teenage. CLN3 disease, classic juvenile. Onset is usually between ages four and ten years. Rapidly progressing visual loss resulting in severe visual impairment within one to two years is often the first clinical sign.

GeneReviews generalized tonic-clonic seizures and/or complex-partial seizures typically appears around age ten years. Life expectancy ranges from the late teens to the 30s. Other forms of NCL may present with behavior changes, epilepsy, visual impairment, or slowing of developmental progress and then loss of skills. The course may be extremely variable. Some genotype-phenotype information is available. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of an NCL is increasingly based on assay of enzyme activity and molecular genetic testing. In unusual cases diagnosis relies on electron microscopy (EM) of biopsied tissues. The diagnostic testing strategy in a proband depends on the age of onset. Pathogenic variants in thirteen genes PPT1, TPP1, CLN3, CLN5, CLN6, MFSD8, CLN8, CTSD, DNAJC5, CTSF, ATP13A2, GRN, KCTD7 are known to cause NCL. Management Treatment of manifestations: Treatment is currently symptomatic and palliative only. Seizures, malnutrition, gastroesophageal reflux, pneumonia, sialorrhea, depression and anxiety, spasticity, Parkinsonian symptoms, and dystonia can be effectively managed. Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) should be selected with caution. Benzodiazepines may help control seizures, anxiety, and spasticity. Trihexyphenydate may improve dystonia and sialorrhea. Individuals with swallowing problems may benefit from placement of a gastric (G) tube. Antidepressants and antipsychotic agents are sometimes indicated for those with CLN3 disease. Surveillance: Routine medical management of children and young adults with complex neurodisability will be relevant to all those affected by NCL, and may include surveillance for swallowing difficulties and recurrent aspiration; radiograph surveillance of hip joints and spine; screening ECG for those with CLN3 disease who are older than age 16 years. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Carbamazepine and phenytoin may increase seizure activity and myoclonus and result in clinical deterioration; lamotrigine may exacerbate seizures and myoclonus, especially in CLN2 disease. Genetic counseling The NCLs are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner with the exception of adult onset, which can be inherited in either an autosomal recessive or an autosomal dominant manner. Autosomal recessive NCL. The parents of a child with an autosomal recessive form of NCL are obligate heterozygotes, and therefore carry one mutated allele. Heterozygotes have no symptoms. At conception, each sib has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Carrier testing for at-risk relatives is possible if the pathogenic variants in the family are known. Prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk is possible if the proband has documented deficient enzyme activity or if the pathogenic variant(s) have been identified in the family."

Affected untreated infants usually have poor feeding and failure to thrive, and rapid onset of severe dehydration with illness, hot environment, or the withholding of water. Short stature and secondary dilatation of the ureters and bladder from the high urine volume is common in untreated individuals. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of hereditary NDI is established in a male proband with NDI by identification of a hemizygous pathogenic variant in AVPR2 or identification of a compound heterozygous or homozygous pathogenic variant in AQP2 by molecular genetic testing. The diagnosis of hereditary NDI is usually established in a female proband with NDI by identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in AVPR2 or identification of a compound heterozygous or homozygous pathogenic variant in AQP2 by molecular genetic testing.

The clinical classification defines six forms of NM, which are classified by onset and severity of motor and respiratory involvement: Severe congenital (neonatal) (16% of all individuals with NM) Amish NM Intermediate congenital (20%) Typical congenital (46%) Childhood-onset (13%) Adult-onset (late-onset) (4%) Considerable overlap occurs among the forms. There are significant differences in survival between individuals classified as having severe, intermediate, and typical congenital NM. Severe neonatal respiratory disease and the presence of arthrogryposis multiplex congenita are associated with death in the first year of life.

Pathogenic variants have been identified in ten different genes, six of which encode protein components of the muscle thin filament, while three appear to be involved in the protein turnover in the muscle sarcomere via the ubiquitin proteosome pathway. Management Treatment of manifestations: Aggressive treatment of lower respiratory tract infections, ventilator use for nocturnal hypoxia, preoperative assessment of pulmonary function to ensure optimal timing of surgical procedures and to minimize anesthetic risk, monitoring of nutritional status, special feeding techniques, standard care for gastroesophageal reflux, mobility and physical therapy to help prevent joint contractures, speech therapy, and assessment of cardiac status. Surveillance: Routine assessment for respiratory function, scoliosis, joint contractures, and the need for assistive devices. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Neuromuscular blocking agents, because of possible association with malignant hyperthermia susceptibility. Genetic counseling NM is inherited in an autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive manner. In one series, approximately 20% of cases were autosomal recessive, approximately 30% autosomal dominant, and approximately 50% simplex (i.e., single occurrences in a family) representing heterozygosity for a de novo dominant pathogenic variant or biallelic autosomal recessive pathogenic variant. Accurate recurrence risk information requires determination of the mode of inheritance, if possible, through pedigree analysis and a combination of clinical evaluation, molecular genetic testing, and muscle biopsy of the parents. Carrier testing for at-risk relatives in families with autosomal recessive NM is possible if the pathogenic variants in the family are known. Prenatal molecular genetic testing is possible for pregnancies at increased risk for autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive NM if the pathogenic variant(s) in the family are known."

About half of people with NF1 have plexiform neurofibromas, but most are internal and not suspected clinically. Plexiform neurofibromas can cause pain, neurologic deficits, and abnormalities of involved or adjacent structures. Less common but potentially more serious manifestations include optic nerve and other central nervous system gliomas, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, scoliosis, tibial dysplasia, vasculopathy, and gastrointestinal, endocrine, or pulmonary disease. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of NF1 is established in a proband with two or more of the characteristic clinical features or one characteristic clinical feature and a heterozygous NF1 pathogenic variant. Management Treatment of manifestations: Referral to specialists for treatment of abnormalities of the eye, central or peripheral nervous system, cardiovascular system, lungs, endocrine system, spine, or long bones; surgical removal of disfiguring or uncomfortable discrete cutaneous or subcutaneous neurofibromas. Surgical treatment of diffuse or large plexiform neurofibromas is possible but may be associated with damage to involved nerves or adjacent tissues and stimulate growth of residual tumor. Complete surgical excision, when possible, of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors is the treatment of choice; chemotherapy may be beneficial in some individuals. Treatment of optic gliomas is generally unnecessary as they are usually asymptomatic and clinically stable. Dystrophic scoliosis often requires surgical management, whereas nondystrophic scoliosis can usually be treated conservatively. Individualized developmental and educational interventions may be beneficial, and methylphenidate treatment often benefits individuals with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.

Affected individuals may also develop schwannomas of other cranial and peripheral nerves, meningiomas, ependymomas, and (very rarely) low-grade astrocytomas. Because NF2 is considered an adult-onset disease, it may be underrecognized in children, in whom skin tumors and ocular findings (retinal hamartoma, thickened optic nerves, cortical wedge cataracts, third cranial nerve palsy) may be the first manifestations. Mononeuropathy that occurs in childhood is an increasingly recognized finding; it frequently presents as a persistent facial palsy or hand/foot drop. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of NF2 is established in a proband with bilateral vestibular schwannomas, an identical NF2 pathogenic variant identified in two or more anatomically distinct NF2-related tumors, or a combination of clinical and molecular criteria that fulfill the consensus diagnostic criteria.

Approximately 50% of individuals diagnosed with NF2 have the disorder as the result of a de novo NF2 pathogenic variant. As many as 25% to 50% of individuals with a de novo NF2 pathogenic variant have somatic mosaicism for the variant. The possibility that a parent has NF2 can be excluded if the proband is shown to be mosaic. Each child of an individual with NF2 has up to a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant: offspring of an individual with a germline pathogenic variant have a 50% chance of inheriting the variant, while offspring of an individual who has mosaic NF2 may have a less than 50% risk of inheriting the variant. Once the NF2 pathogenic variant has been identified in the family, prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing are possible."

Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of NFIA-related disorder is established in a proband by detection of one of the following: a heterozygous intragenic NFIA pathogenic variant; a heterozygous deletion of the 1p31.3 region that includes part or all of NFIA with surrounding genes intact; or a chromosome translocation/other rearrangement with a 1p31.3 breakpoint that disrupts NFIA. Management Treatment of manifestations: Standard treatment of seizure disorder, tethered spinal cord, recurrent urinary tract infections, hydronephrosis, strabismus, craniosynostosis, and developmental delays. Surveillance: Affected individuals should be followed by the appropriate specialists (e.g., neurologist, urologist, and/or clinical geneticist) as needed based on their particular features.

Affected individuals typically have distinctive facial features, including a long and triangular face, high anterior hair line with prominent forehead, depressed nasal bridge, deep-set eyes, downslanted palpebral fissures, short nose with anteverted nares and upturned tip, long philtrum, small mouth that is often held open, thin vermilion of the upper lip, an everted lower lip, and a prominent chin. Other findings may include autonomic signs (episodic ataxia with dizziness and nausea and/or postural fainting), seizures or EEG abnormalities, hypotonia, dental anomalies, long bone fractures, and (rarely) congenital heart defects. Four individuals with aortic root dilatation have been reported, with one adult individual experiencing progressive aortic dilation and dissection at age 38 years. Additionally, one individual with rib osteosarcoma and another with Wilms tumor have been reported (an overall prevalence of malignancy of about 2%). Therefore, MALNS appears to be in the same low risk group as Sotos syndrome and Weaver syndrome with respect to a low likelihood of developing cancer. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of MALNS is established in a proband with suggestive findings and either a heterozygous pathogenic variant in NFIX (~75% of affected individuals) OR a heterozygous deletion of 19p13.2 that includes NFIX (~25% of affected individuals) identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Feeding therapy with a low threshold for clinical feeding evaluation &/or radiographic swallowing study for those with clinical signs or symptoms of dysphagia; gastrostomy tube placement may be required for persistent feeding issues.

Symptomatic treatment for autonomic signs based on the underlying cause. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) may be used to treat anxiety and ADHD. Symptomatic aids (i.e., colored glasses, low voice tone) may reduce anxiety outbursts. Hearing aids may be helpful per otolaryngologist. Standard treatment for epilepsy, Chari I malformation, developmental delay / intellectual disability, scoliosis/ kyphosis, pes planus, pectus anomalies, refractive error, strabismus, tooth anomalies / malocclusion, aortic root dilatation / valvular issues, and cryptorchidism. Surveillance: At each visit, measure growth parameters and evaluate nutritional status and safety of oral intake; monitor for signs/symptoms of constipation, Chari I malformation, and subtle and nonspecific neurovegetative findings; and assess for new manifestations, such as seizures and changes in tone. The first BMI evaluation should be performed after age two years; assess caloric intake and BMI every six months during the first two years of life, then at least annually. Monitor developmental progress, educational needs, and psychopathologic symptoms annually from age 12 months to age 36 months and then approximately every two years from age three to six years. Annual ophthalmology evaluation until puberty and then periodically in adults to evaluate for late-onset optic nerve degeneration. Annual audiology evaluation in childhood or as clinically indicated. At least annual routine dental/orthodontic evaluation. Consider DXA scan for bone mineral density periodically in those with a history of multiple fractures or previous low bone mineral density. If the baseline cardiovascular evaluation is normal, consider annual cardiology follow up; limited data on aortic root progression is available for adults. No tumor screening protocols have been proposed or recommended for individuals with MALNS. Genetic counseling MALNS is an autosomal dominant disorder typically caused by a de novo genetic alteration. Therefore, the risk to other family members is presumed to be low. Rarely, individuals diagnosed with MALNS have the disorder as the result of a genetic alteration inherited from a mosaic parent. Families with sib recurrence due to parental gonadal (or somatic and gonadal) mosaicism have been reported. Once an NFIX pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing are possible."

For heterozygous adults. Monitor for malignancy, particularly breast cancer in women and prostate cancer in men. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Because the cells from individuals with NBS are radiosensitive in vitro, doses of radiation used in radiotherapy need to be reduced.

Live vaccines (e.g., live vaccines for tuberculosis, measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella) should not be given. Evaluation of relatives at risk: It is appropriate to offer molecular genetic testing for the familial NBN pathogenic variants to apparently asymptomatic adult relatives of an affected individual in order to identify family members who are heterozygous for an NBN pathogenic variant and would benefit from monitoring for malignancy.

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Nonketotic hyperglycinemia (NKH) is the inborn error of glycine metabolism defined by deficient activity of the glycine cleavage enzyme system (GCS), which results in accumulation of large quantities of glycine in all body tissues including the brain. Based on ultimate outcome NKH is categorized into severe NKH (no developmental progress and intractable epilepsy) and attenuated NKH (variable developmental progress and treatable or no epilepsy). The majority of children with NKH have onset in the neonatal period manifest as progressive lethargy evolving into profound coma and marked hypotonia; 85% have severe NKH and 15% attenuated NKH. Those with onset between two weeks and three months typically present with hypotonia; 50% have severe NKH and 50% attenuated NKH. Those with onset after age three months have attenuated NKH. Severe versus attenuated NKH is consistent within families, but the degree of developmental progress in those with attenuated NKH can vary. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of NKH is established in a proband with elevated glycine in plasma and CSF, a compatible pattern on brain imaging, and either biallelic pathogenic variants in one of the genes encoding the protein subunits of the GCS identified on molecular genetic testing or deficient activity of the GCS (without deficiency of cofactors such as enzyme-bound lipoate or pyridoxal phosphate).

Attenuated NKH. Current treatment is reduction of plasma concentration of glycine by administration of sodium benzoate and blockade of overstimulated NMDA receptors. Surveillance: In the first years of life: routine developmental assessments and neurologic evaluations. Monitoring for scoliosis and hip dysplasia in severely affected individuals; gastrointestinal issues; and pulmonary function particularly in children who develop recurrent respiratory infections. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Valproate, which raises blood and CSF glycine concentrations and may increase seizure frequency; vigabatrin, which has resulted in rapid loss of function when used to treat seizures, particularly in those with attenuated NKH who have West syndrome. Genetic counseling NKH is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. The parents of an affected individual are typically heterozygotes (i.e., carriers of one NKH-related pathogenic variant); however, de novo pathogenic variants occur in approximately 1% of individuals with NKH.

Other findings can include broad or webbed neck, unusual chest shape with superior pectus carinatum and inferior pectus excavatum, cryptorchidism, varied coagulation defects, lymphatic dysplasias, and ocular abnormalities. Although birth length is usually normal, final adult height approaches the lower limit of normal. Congenital heart disease occurs in 50%-80% of individuals. Pulmonary valve stenosis, often with dysplasia, is the most common heart defect and is found in 20%-50% of individuals. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, found in 20%-30% of individuals, may be present at birth or develop in infancy or childhood. Other structural defects include atrial and ventricular septal defects, branch pulmonary artery stenosis, and tetralogy of Fallot. Up to one fourth of affected individuals have mild intellectual disability, and language impairments in general are more common in NS than in the general population. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of Noonan is established in a proband with suggestive findings and a heterozygous pathogenic variant in BRAF, KRAS, MAP2K1, MRAS, NRAS, PTPN11, RAF1, RASA2, RIT1, RRAS2, SOS1, or SOS2 or either a heterozygous variant or biallelic pathogenic variants in LZTR1 identified by molecular genetic testing. Several additional genes associated with a Noonan syndrome-like phenotype in fewer than ten individuals have been identified.

Annually in childhood or as clinically indicated: ophthalmology and audiology evaluations. In children age <5 years: if initial cardiac evaluation is normal, at least annual cardiac evaluations until age 5 years. In children age >5 years through adulthood, cardiac evaluation at least every 5 years, or as clinically indicated. Prior to any surgical procedure or in those with clinical bleeding: assessment of bleeding history, CBC with differential, and consideration of measurement of coagulation factors. For those with pathogenic PTPN11 or KRAS variants: consider physical examination with assessment of spleen size & CBC every 3-6 months until age 5 years to assess for concerns about JMML/malignancy. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Aspirin therapy should be avoided because it may exacerbate a bleeding diathesis. Pregnancy management: Consider referral to an adult congenital heart program for peripartum evaluation and management; consider a hematology referral if the affected pregnant woman has a history of bleeding abnormalities and/or has not undergone previous screening for coagulopathy. Genetic counseling NS is most often inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. While many individuals with autosomal dominant NS have a de novo pathogenic variant, an affected parent is recognized in 30%-75% of families. The risk to sibs of a proband with autosomal dominant NS depends on the genetic status of the parents: if a parent is affected, the risk is 50%; when the parents are clinically unaffected, the risk to the sibs of a proband appears to be low (<1%). Each child of an individual with autosomal dominant NS has a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant. NS caused by pathogenic variants in LZTR1 can be inherited in either an autosomal dominant or an autosomal recessive manner. The parents of an individual with autosomal recessive NS are typically heterozygotes (i.e., have one LZTR1 pathogenic variant), and may either be asymptomatic or have mild features of NS. If both parents are heterozygous for one LZTR1 pathogenic variant, each sib of an affected individual has at conception a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of having one LZTR1 pathogenic variant (which can be associated with mild NS features), and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Prenatal testing and preimplantation genetic testing are possible if the NS-related pathogenic variant(s) have been identified in an affected family member."

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics NDP-related retinopathies typically involve bilateral and symmetric fibrovascular changes of the retina that are evident at birth and usually progress through childhood or adolescence to cause varying degrees of visual impairment. The spectrum of NDP-related retinopathies appears to be a continuum with considerable overlap, ranging from Norrie disease, NDP-related persistent fetal vasculature, NDP-related familial exudative vitreoretinopathy, NDP-related advanced retinopathy of prematurity, and NDP-related Coats disease. The eye findings of Norrie disease, the first described and best characterized of these disorders, are typically bilateral grayish-yellow, glistening, elevated retrolental masses composed of immature retinal cells usually visible through clear lenses; foveal development is always incomplete. In addition, Norrie disease is the only NDP-related retinopathy with associated extraocular findings, which can variably include cognitive disability, mental health and behavior disorders, seizures, sensorineural hearing loss, and peripheral vascular disease. Rarely, females who are heterozygous for an NDP pathogenic variant have clinical manifestations including retinal and extraocular features that may vary between other family members heterozygous for the same NDP pathogenic variant. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of an NDP-related retinopathy, an X-linked disorder, is established in a male proband with suggestive clinical findings by identification on molecular genetic testing of a hemizygous pathogenic variant in NDP; and in a female proband with suggestive clinical findings by identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in NDP.

Management GeneReviews Treatment of manifestations: Based on a child's ocular findings, pediatric ophthalmologists and pediatric vitreoretinal surgeons individualize management to reduce increased intraocular pressure to decrease the risk of glaucoma; treat refractive errors and/or strabismus to optimize vision and ocular alignment; and discuss risks and benefits of possible vision-saving surgical intervention. Other issues are addressed by multidisciplinary specialists, typically: low-vision specialists, neurologists, pediatricians, developmental pediatricians, pediatric sleep specialists, mental health specialists, physiatrists, occupational and physical therapists, audiologists, and speech-language pathologists. Surveillance: Routine monitoring of: ophthalmologic manifestations and low vision needs; hearing; developmental progress and educational needs; neurologic and mental health manifestations; peripheral vascular disease; and response to treatment. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Situations that could exacerbate hearing loss such as loud noises and use of listening devices that amplify sound. Evaluation of relatives at risk: Clarify the genetic status of apparently asymptomatic older and younger at-risk female relatives so that those with the familial NDP pathogenic have the option to undergo fluorescein angiography to detect peripheral retinal vascular changes that may require close monitoring and/or prophylactic laser photocoagulation to decrease the risk of neovascularization and vitreoretinal traction. Genetic counseling NDP-related retinopathies are inherited in an X-linked manner. The majority of affected males have the disorder as the result of an NDP pathogenic variant inherited from their mother. If the mother of the proband has an NDP pathogenic variant (i.e., is a carrier), the chance of transmitting it in each pregnancy is 50%: males who inherit the pathogenic variant will be affected; females who inherit the pathogenic variant will be heterozygous and may rarely have clinical manifestations. Affected males transmit the NDP pathogenic variant to all of their daughters and none of their sons. Once the NDP pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, testing for females at risk of being carriers and prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing are possible."

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics The phenotype of acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD) occurs along a continuum. Individuals with the severe early-onset form, infantile neurovisceral ASMD, were historically diagnosed with Niemann-Pick disease type A (NPD-A). The later-onset, chronic visceral form of ASMD is also referred to as Niemann-Pick disease type B (NPD-B). A phenotype with intermediate severity is also known as chronic neurovisceral ASMD (NPD- A/B). Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is currently FDA approved for the non-central nervous system manifestations of ASMD, regardless of type. As more affected individuals are treated with ERT for longer periods of time, the natural history of ASMD is likely to change. The most common presenting symptom in untreated NPD-A is hepatosplenomegaly, usually detectable by age three months; over time the liver and spleen become massive in size. Growth failure typically becomes evident by the second year of life. Psychomotor development progresses no further than the 12-month level, after which neurologic deterioration is relentless. This feature may not be amenable to ERT. A classic cherry-red spot of the macula of the retina, which may not be present in the first few months, is eventually present in all affected children, although it is unclear if ERT will have an impact on this. Interstitial lung disease caused by storage of sphingomyelin in pulmonary macrophages results in frequent respiratory infections and often respiratory failure. Most untreated children succumb before the third year of life. NPD-B generally presents later than NPD-A, and the manifestations are less severe. NPD-B is characterized in untreated individuals by progressive hepatosplenomegaly, gradual deterioration in liver and pulmonary function, osteopenia, and atherogenic lipid profile. No central nervous system manifestations occur. Individuals with NPD-A/B have symptoms that are intermediate between NPD-A and NPD-B. The presentation in individuals with NPD-A/B varies greatly, although all are characterized by the presence of some central nervous system manifestations. Survival to adulthood can occur in individuals with NPD-B and NPD-A/B, even when untreated.

Diagnosis/testing GeneReviews The diagnosis of ASMD is established by detection of biallelic pathogenic variants in SMPD1 by molecular genetic testing and residual acid sphingomyelinase enzyme activity that is less than 10% of controls (in peripheral blood lymphocytes or cultured skin fibroblasts). Management Targeted therapies: Olipudase alfa (Xenpozyme) enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) helps to reduce the accumulation of sphingomyelin in the lung, liver, spleen, and other non-central nervous system organs. It does not impact the central nervous system and therefore does not impact the neurocognitive issues seen in individuals with NPD-A or NPD-A/B. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) can correct the metabolic defect, improve blood counts, and reduce increased liver and spleen volumes but does not stabilize neurologic disease. The morbidity and mortality associated with HSCT limit its use, and it is likely to become obsolete now that enzyme replacement therapy is available. Supportive care: Feeding therapy and/or feeding tube as needed for nutritional support; supportive management of coagulopathy and end-stage liver disease manifestations; transfusion of blood products for life-threatening bleeding; partial splenectomy may be considered for individuals with severe hypersplenism; supplemental oxygen for symptomatic pulmonary disease; physical and occupational therapy to maximize function and to prevent contractures; early intervention and developmental support for those with developmental issues; treatment of hyperlipidemia in adults; calcium and vitamin D for osteopenia/osteoporosis; sedatives for irritability and sleep disturbance as indicated. Prevention of secondary complications: Monitor liver function in individuals receiving hepatotoxic medications (e.g., statins for hypercholesterolemia). Surveillance: Periodic assessments of nutritional status; annual EKG; echocardiogram every two to four years; liver transaminases (ALT, AST), albumin, clotting factors, and platelet count at least annually; assess for fatigue, abdominal pain, and/or increased bleeding at least annually; radiologic measurements of liver and spleen size as needed; assess for shortness of breath at each visit; annual pulmonary function testing; chest radiograph every two to four years; assess neurologic function and frequency of headaches at least annually; monitor developmental progress, educational needs, and occupational and physical therapy needs at each visit; fasting lipid profile at least annually; assess for extremity pain at each visit; bone density assessment every two to four years; assess need for family support and resources at each visit. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Contact sports in those who have splenomegaly. Pregnancy management: For pregnant women with ASMD, prenatal care by a high-risk obstetrician is indicated to ensure appropriate monitoring of pulmonary function and hematologic status. Olipudase alfa ERT has not been studied in pregnant women, but animal studies have identified a potential impact on fetal development. Therefore, ERT is not recommended during pregnancy. Genetic counseling All forms of ASMD (NPD-A, NPD-A/B, and NPD-B) are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. If both parents are known to be heterozygous for an SMPD1 pathogenic variant, each sib of an affected individual has at conception a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being a carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Once the SMPD1 pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member, carrier testing for at-risk relatives and prenatal/preimplantation genetic testing are possible.

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC) is a slowly progressive lysosomal disorder whose principal manifestations are age dependent. The manifestations in the perinatal period and infancy are predominantly visceral, with hepatosplenomegaly, jaundice, and (in some instances) pulmonary infiltrates. From late infancy onward, the presentation is dominated by neurologic manifestations. The youngest children may present with hypotonia and developmental delay, with the subsequent emergence of ataxia, dysarthria, dysphagia, and, in some individuals, epileptic seizures, dystonia, and gelastic cataplexy. Although cognitive impairment may be subtle at first, it eventually becomes apparent that affected individuals have a progressive dementia. Older teenagers and young adults may present predominantly with apparent early-onset dementia or psychiatric manifestations; however, careful examination usually identifies typical neurologic signs. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of NPC is established in a proband with suggestive findings and biallelic pathogenic variants in either NPC1 or NPC2 identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: No curative therapy for NPC exists. Supportive therapy is provided by specialists from multiple disciplines including among others: neurology, physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, nutrition, feeding, psychology, social work, and medical genetics. Treatment with miglustat, approved for the management of neurologic manifestations of NPC in several countries but not the United States, has increased survival by five years from date of diagnosis or approximately ten years from onset of neurologic manifestations. Surveillance: Routine follow up by multidisciplinary specialists to monitor disease progression and supportive management including psychosocial support to identify new manifestations of disease, and, for those on Author Affiliation: 1 Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota; Email: patterson.marc@mayo.edu.

GeneReviews miglustat, to assess compliance, possible side effects, and appearance of conditions that would prompt discontinuation of therapy. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Drugs that cause excessive salivation or that may exacerbate seizures directly by interacting with anti-seizure medication; alcohol as well as many drugs that exacerbate ataxia. Evaluation of relatives at risk: It is appropriate to clarify the genetic status of apparently asymptomatic older and younger at-risk relatives of an affected individual in order to identify as early as possible those who are symptomatic and would benefit from prompt initiation of treatment. Genetic counseling NPC is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. If both parents are known to be heterozygous for an NPC- related pathogenic variant, each sib of an affected individual has at conception a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being a heterozygote, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a heterozygote. Once the NPC-causing pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member, carrier testing for at-risk relatives, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk, and preimplantation genetic testing are possible."

CHILD syndrome is characterized by unilateral distribution of ichthyosiform skin lesions and ipsilateral limb defects that range from shortening of the metacarpals and phalanges to absence of the entire limb. Intellect is usually normal. The ichthyosiform skin lesions are usually present at birth or in the first weeks of life; new lesions can develop in later life. Onychodystrophy and periungual hyperkeratosis are common. Heart, lung, and kidney malformations can also occur. CK syndrome is characterized by mild-to-severe cognitive impairment and behavior problems (aggression, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder [ADHD], and irritability). All reported affected males have developed seizures in infancy and have cerebral cortical malformations and microcephaly. All have distinctive facial features, a thin habitus, and relatively long, thin fingers and toes. Some have scoliosis and kyphosis. Strabismus is common. Optic atrophy is also reported. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of CHILD syndrome is established in a female proband with a heterozygous NSDHL pathogenic variant identified by molecular genetic testing that results in loss of functional decarboxylating sterol-4-alpha- carboxylate 3-dehydrogenase, the protein encoded by NSDHL. The diagnosis of CK syndrome is established in a male proband with a hemizygous NSDHL hypomorphic pathogenic variant identified by molecular genetic testing that results in partial loss of functional decarboxylating sterol-4-alpha-carboxylate 3-dehydrogenase.

Management GeneReviews Treatment of manifestations: In CHILD syndrome, no one therapy described to date appears to ameliorate the cutaneous findings for every reported individual. Oral and topical ketoconazole may reduce lesions. Topical statin treatment alone or combined with cholesterol and/or glycolic acid can be beneficial. Treatment of an inflammatory nevus by grafting skin obtained from a contralateral unaffected region has been successful. Lactic acid 12% creams or lotions can reduce itching, and urea skin creams can reduce dryness. Scoliosis and joint contractures are treated with braces and/or corrective surgery. Standard management for heart, lung, kidney, and gastrointestinal manifestations. In CK syndrome, developmental and educational support; behavior modification and/or drug therapy to control aggression and help with manifestations of ADHD; anti-seizure medication to control seizures; standard treatments for orthopedic and ocular manifestations; support transition to adult care; and social work and family support as needed. Surveillance: In CHILD syndrome, monitor for new cutaneous lesions, musculoskeletal deformities such as scoliosis and joint contractures, and neurologic, cardiac, and/or kidney manifestations annually or as needed. In CK syndrome, monitor for developmental and educational progress, behavioral issues, changes in seizures, and development of scoliosis and/or kyphosis annually or as needed. Follow-up ophthalmology examination per ophthalmologist. Genetic counseling NSDHL-related disorders are inherited in an X-linked manner. CHILD syndrome is usually male lethal during gestation and thus predominantly affects females. CK syndrome predominantly affects males. CHILD syndrome: If the mother of a proband has an NSDHL pathogenic variant, the chance of transmitting it in each pregnancy is 50%. However, since studies suggest that male conceptuses with an NSDHL pathogenic variant generally abort or resorb spontaneously, the expected live-born distribution is: 33% heterozygous (typically) affected females; 33% unaffected females; and 33% unaffected males. CK syndrome: If the mother of a proband is heterozygous for an NSDHL pathogenic variant, the expected chance of transmitting it in each pregnancy is 50%: males who inherit the pathogenic variant will be affected; females who inherit the pathogenic variant will be heterozygous and may have a range of behavioral problems. Identification of female heterozygotes requires prior identification of the NSDHL pathogenic variant in the family. Once the NSDHL pathogenic variant has been identified in a family member with an NSDHL-related disorder, prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing are possible."

Colorectal polyps can be adenomatous, hyperplastic, and/or sessile serrated. Duodenal polyposis has also been reported. Additional cancers reported in individuals with NTHL1 tumor syndrome include endometrial cancer, cervical cancer, urothelial carcinoma of the bladder, meningiomas, unspecified brain tumors, basal cell carcinomas, head and neck squamous cell carcinomas, and hematologic malignancies. The cumulative lifetime risk of developing extracolonic cancer by age 60 years has been estimated at 35% to 78%.

Individuals with OCA2 are usually recognized within the first three to six months of life because of the ocular features of visual inattention, nystagmus, and strabismus. Vision is stable to slowly improving after early childhood until mid- to late teens, and no major change or loss of established visual acuity occurs related to the albinism. The amount of cutaneous pigmentation in OCA2 ranges from minimal to near- normal compared to others of the same ethnic and family backgrounds. Newborns with OCA2 almost always have lightly pigmented hair, brows, and lashes, with color ranging from light yellow to blond to brown. Hair color may darken with age but does not vary substantially from adolescence to adulthood. Brown OCA, initially identified in Africans and African Americans with light brown hair and skin, is part of the spectrum of OCA2.

Newborns with OCA4 usually have some pigment in their hair, with color ranging from silvery white to light yellow. Hair color may darken with time, but does not vary significantly from childhood to adulthood. Diagnosis/testing Because the phenotype of OCA4 overlaps that of the other genetic forms of albinism (oculocutaneous and ocular), the diagnosis of OCA4 is established by molecular genetic testing with the identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in SLC45A2. A multigene panel or comprehensive genomic testing is the preferred molecular genetic testing method for this disorder. Management Treatment of manifestations: Correction of refractive errors with spectacles or contact lenses to improve visual acuity. Strabismus surgery may be considered for cosmetic reasons. Dark glasses may alleviate photophobia but may reduce vision; a hat with a brim or visor best achieves reduction in photophobia.

Some children have altered development of neural crest-derived structures (i.e., Hirschsprung disease, altered esophageal motility/dysphagia, and severe constipation even in the absence of Hirschsprung disease) and/or tumors of neural crest origin (neuroblastoma, ganglioneuroma, Author Affiliations: 1 Professor of Pediatrics and Beatrice Cummings Mayer Professor of Pediatric Autonomic Medicine, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chief, Division of Autonomic Medicine, Center for Autonomic Medicine in Pediatrics (CAMP), Ann & Robert H Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago and Stanley Manne Children's Research Institute Chicago, Illinois; Email: dweese-mayer@luriechildrens.org; d-weese-mayer@northwestern.edu. 2 Senior Research Manager, Division of Autonomic Medicine, Center for Autonomic Medicine in Pediatrics (CAMP), Ann & Robert H Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago and Stanley Manne Children's Research Institute Chicago, Illinois; Email: crand@luriechildrens.org. 3 Assistant Professor of Pediatrics, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine; Division of Autonomic Medicine, Center for Autonomic Medicine in Pediatrics (CAMP), Ann & Robert H Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago and Stanley Manne Children's Research Institute Chicago, Illinois; Email: ikhaytin@luriechildrens.org; ilya.khaytin@northwestern.edu; Email: sslattery@luriechildrens.org; susan.slattery@northwestern.edu. 4 Assistant Professor of Pathology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Director, Molecular Diagnostics Laboratory, Ann & Robert H Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago Chicago, Illinois; Email: klyap@luriechildrens.org. 5 Founder and Co-Director, Center for Craniofacial and Dental Genetics, Distinguished Professor, Department of Oral Biology, School of Dental Medicine, Professor, Department of Human Genetics, Graduate School of Public Health, Professor, Clinical and Translational Science, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Email: marazita@pitt.edu. 6 Professor, Departments of Pediatrics, Neurological Sciences, and Biochemistry, Co-Director, Molecular Diagnostics Laboratory, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois; Email: elizabeth_m_berry- kravis@rush.edu.

Neurocognitive delay is variable, and possibly influenced by cyanotic breath holding, prolonged sinus pauses, need for 24-hour/day artificial ventilation, and seizures. Later-onset CCHS is characterized by alveolar hypoventilation during sleep and attenuated manifestations of ANSD. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of CCHS is established in a proband with suggestive findings and a heterozygous PHOX2B pathogenic variant identified on molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Management by multidisciplinary specialists, including pediatric pulmonology, sleep medicine, cardiology, oncology, ophthalmology, gastroenterology, neurodevelopmental psychology, and neurology, is recommended. The treatment goals for CCHS are to secure the airway and to use chronic artificial ventilatory support at home to compensate for the hypoventilation and the altered/absent ventilatory responses to hypoxemia and hypercarbia. Prolonged transient asystoles that may present as syncope and/or staring spells and are of significant duration (3.0 seconds) may warrant placement of a cardiac pacemaker; abnormal pupillary reactivity may necessitate protective eye wear given the amount of light exposure in daily life from LED lights, and screen time in educational settings, computer-based work environments, and mobile devices. Other findings treated as per standard practice include Hirschsprung disease and other gastrointestinal motility issues; tumors of neural crest origin; and cognitive impairment/delay. Surveillance: Assess every six months for the first three years, then annually thereafter: (1) in a pediatric respiratory physiology laboratory spontaneous breathing awake (in varied age-appropriate activities of daily living during the daytime and before sleep) and asleep, with recording of respiratory inductance plethysmography of the chest and abdomen, hemoglobin saturation with pulse waveform, end-tidal carbon dioxide level with visible waveform, electrocardiogram, blood pressure, cerebral regional blood flow/ oxygenation, and appropriate sleep state staging measures; (2) hemoglobin/hematocrit and reticulocyte count for polycythemia; (3) 72-hour Holter recording for abrupt, prolonged asystoles; (4) echocardiogram changes consistent with right ventricular hypertrophy and cor pulmonale; (5) neurocognitive assessment/educational needs; and (6) comprehensive age-appropriate noninvasive autonomic testing. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Swimming and breath-holding contests (risk of asphyxia, death); alcohol (respiratory depression), recreational drugs (varied effects including death), and prescription as well as non- prescription medications/sedatives/anesthetics that could induce respiratory depression. Evaluation of relatives at risk: It is appropriate to clarify the genetic status of parents, sibs, and offspring of an individual with CCHS in order to identify as early as possible family members who would benefit from prompt initiation of treatment, surveillance, and awareness of agents/circumstances to avoid. Genetic counseling CCHS is typically inherited in an autosomal dominant manner (CCHS caused by biallelic reduced penetrance PHOX2B pathogenic variants has been reported in two families). The majority of affected individuals have the disorder as the result of a de novo pathogenic variant. Somatic/germline mosaicism is present in 5%-25% of asymptomatic parents. If a parent of the proband is known to be heterozygous for the PHOX2B pathogenic variant identified in the proband, the risk to the sibs of inheriting the pathogenic variant is 50%. Once the PHOX2B pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible (because of the high frequency of parental mosaicism in CCHS, a fetus should be considered at risk for CCHS even if the PHOX2B pathogenic variant detected in the proband was not identified in either parent).

Developmental delay and intellectual disability are observed in about 30% of affected males. Cleft lip and/or palate are present in approximately half of affected males. Other malformations (present in <50% of affected males) include congenital heart defects, imperforate or ectopic anus, and midline brain defects (Dandy-Walker malformation and agenesis or hypoplasia of the corpus callosum and/or cerebellar vermis). Wide clinical variability occurs even among members of the same family. Female heterozygotes usually manifest hypertelorism only. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of MID1-OS is established in a male proband with suggestive findings and a hemizygous pathogenic variant in MID1 identified by molecular genetic testing. Females with a heterozygous MID1 pathogenic variant usually have isolated hypertelorism and only rarely present with other manifestations of MID1-OS. Management Treatment of manifestations: Management of anomalies by a multidisciplinary team; surgical treatment of cleft lip/palate and other craniofacial anomalies; standard treatments for hearing loss including PE tubes; speech therapy; standard dental treatments as needed for hypodontia; standard surgical management of hypospadias; surgical treatment for medically significant laryngotracheoesophageal abnormalities; anti-reflux therapy as needed; neuropsychological and educational support; surgical repair of congenital heart defects and imperforate anus; surgical treatment and/or refractive lenses as needed per ophthalmologist.

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) is characterized by ptosis and dysphagia due to selective involvement of the muscles of the eyelids and pharynx, respectively. For the vast majority of individuals with typical OPMD, the mean age of onset of ptosis is usually 48 years and of dysphagia 50 years; in 5%-10% of individuals with severe OPMD, onset of ptosis and dysphagia occur before age 45 years and is associated with lower limb girdle weakness starting around age 60 years. Swallowing difficulties, which determine prognosis, increase the risk for potentially life-threatening aspiration pneumonia and poor nutrition. Other manifestations as the disease progresses can include limitation of upward gaze, tongue atrophy and weakness, chewing difficulties, wet voice, facial muscle weakness, axial muscle weakness, and proximal limb girdle weakness predominantly in lower limbs. Some individuals with severe involvement will eventually need a wheelchair. Neuropsychological tests have shown altered scores in executive functions in some. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of OPMD is established in a proband with a suggestive phenotype in whom either of the following genetic findings are identified: a heterozygous GCN trinucleotide repeat expansion of 11 to 18 repeats in the first exon of PABPN1 (~90% of affected individuals) or biallelic GCN trinucleotide repeat expansions that are either compound heterozygous (GCN[11] with a second expanded allele) or homozygous (GCN[11]+[11], GCN[12]+[12], GCN[13]+[13], etc.) (~10% of affected individuals).

Management GeneReviews Treatment of manifestations: Treatment for ptosis may include blepharoplasty by either resection of the levator palpebrea aponeurosis or frontal suspension of the eyelids. The initial treatment for dysphagia is dietary modification; surgical intervention for dysphagia should be considered when symptomatic dysphagia has a significant impact on quality of life. Physical and occupational therapy are encouraged; assistive devices may be necessary to prevent falls and assist with walking and mobility. Neuropsychological support as needed. Surveillance: Routine evaluation of: neuromuscular and oculomotor involvement; dysphagia including nutritional status and diet; respiratory function given the increased risk for both aspiration and nocturnal hypoventilation; and cognitive function including development of psychiatric symptoms. Genetic counseling OPMD is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. The risk to sibs of a proband depends on the genetic status of the parents of the proband: If one parent of a proband is heterozygous for a GCN repeat expansion in PABPN1 (GCN[11_18]+ [10]) and the other parent has two normal alleles (GCN[10]+[10]), the risk to the sibs of inheriting a GCN repeat expansion is 50%. If both parents of the proband are heterozygous for a GCN repeat expansion, sibs have a 25% risk of inheriting two GCN repeat expansions and a 50% risk of inheriting one GCN repeat expansion. If one parent of the proband has biallelic GCN repeat expansions and the other parent has two normal alleles, all sibs will inherit a GCN repeat expansion. If one parent of the proband has biallelic GCN repeat expansions and the other parent is heterozygous for a GCN repeat expansion, sibs of the proband have a 50% risk of inheriting biallelic GCN repeat expansions and 50% risk of inheriting one GCN repeat expansion.

Approximately half have associated features including orofacial clefting and hearing loss, and a minority have some degree of developmental delay (usually mild). Radiographic findings of cranial sclerosis, sclerosis of long bones, and metaphyseal striations (in combination with macrocephaly) can be considered pathognomonic. Males can present with a mild or severe phenotype. Mildly affected males have clinical features similar to affected females, including macrocephaly, characteristic facial features, orofacial clefting, hearing loss, and mild-to-moderate learning delays. Mildly affected males are more likely than females to have congenital or musculoskeletal anomalies. Radiographic findings include cranial sclerosis and sclerosis of the long bones; Metaphyseal striations are more common in males who are mosaic for an AMER1 pathogenic variant. The severe phenotype manifests in males as a multiple-malformation syndrome, lethal in mid-to-late gestation, or in the neonatal period. Congenital malformations include skeletal defects (e.g., polysyndactyly, absent or hypoplastic fibulae), congenital heart disease, and brain, genitourinary, and gastrointestinal anomalies. Macrocephaly is not always present and longitudinal metaphyseal striations have not been observed in severely affected males, except for those who are mosaic for the AMER1 pathogenic variant.

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency can occur as a severe neonatal-onset disease in males (but rarely in females) and as a post-neonatal-onset (also known as \\\"late-onset\\\" or partial deficiency) disease in males and females. Males with severe neonatal-onset OTC deficiency are asymptomatic at birth but become symptomatic from hyperammonemia in the first week of life, most often on day two to three of life, and are usually catastrophically ill by the time they come to medical attention. After successful treatment of neonatal hyperammonemic coma these infants can easily become hyperammonemic again despite appropriate treatment; they typically require liver transplant to improve quality of life. Males and heterozygous females with post-neonatal-onset (partial) OTC deficiency can present from infancy to later childhood, adolescence, or adulthood. No matter how mild the disease, a hyperammonemic crisis can be precipitated by stressors and become a life- threatening event at any age and in any situation in life. For all individuals with OTC deficiency, typical neuropsychological complications include developmental delay, learning disabilities, intellectual disability, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and executive function deficits. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of OTC deficiency is established in a male proband with suggestive clinical and laboratory findings and at least ONE of the following: A hemizygous pathogenic variant in OTC by molecular genetic testing A markedly abnormal increase of orotic acid excretion (20 umol/mmol creatinine) in a random urine collection or after an allopurinol challenge test, along with a past medical history of biochemical features Author Affiliations: 1 Division of Genetic & Genomic Medicine UPMC Childrens Hospital of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Email: uta.lichterkonecki@chp.edu. 2 Center for Genetic Medicine Research, Children's National Hospital, Washington, DC. 3 Division of Genetics & Metabolism Children's National Hospital, Washington, DC.

GeneReviews consistent with OTC deficiency (e.g., elevated ammonia, elevated glutamine and low-to-normal citrulline), as well as absence of biochemical or DNA evidence suggestive of another inborn error of metabolism Decreased OTC enzyme activity in liver The diagnosis of OTC deficiency is usually established in a female proband with the suggestive clinical and laboratory findings and with at least ONE of the following: A heterozygous pathogenic variant in OTC by molecular genetic testing A markedly abnormal increase of orotic acid excretion (20 umol/mmol creatinine) in a random urine collection or after an allopurinol challenge test, along with a past medical history of biochemical features consistent with OTC deficiency (e.g., elevated ammonia, elevated glutamine and low-to-normal citrulline), as well as absence of biochemical or DNA evidence suggestive of another inborn error of metabolism Measurement of OTC enzyme activity in liver is not a reliable means of diagnosis in females. Management Treatment of manifestations: Treatment is best provided by a metabolic physician / biochemical geneticist and specialist metabolic dietitian; treatment of hyperammonemic coma should be provided by a team coordinated by a metabolic specialist in a tertiary care center experienced in the management of OTC deficiency. The mainstays of treatment of the acute phase are rapid lowering of the plasma ammonia level to 200 mol/L (if necessary, with renal replacement therapy); use of ammonia scavenger treatment to allow excretion of excess nitrogen via alternative pathways; reversal of catabolism; and reducing the risk of neurologic damage. The goals of long-term treatment are to promote growth and development and to prevent hyperammonemic episodes. In severe, neonatal-onset urea cycle disorders, liver transplantation is typically performed by age six months to prevent further hyperammonemic crises and neurodevelopmental deterioration. In females and males with partial OTC deficiency, liver transplant is typically considered in those who have frequent hyperammonemic episodes. Complications of OTC deficiency, including developmental delay and intellectual disability, are treated according to the standard of care for these conditions while monitoring for signs of liver disease. Surveillance: At the start of therapy, routine measurement of plasma ammonia and plasma amino acids every two weeks with gradual extension of the intervals between testing. Laboratory analysis for vitamin and mineral deficiencies annually or as indicated by the metabolic dietician. Assess liver function (depending on symptoms) every three to six months or more often when previously abnormal. Perform neuropsychological testing at the time of expected significant developmental milestones. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Valproate, haloperidol, fasting, systemic corticosteroids, physical and psychological stress. Evaluation of relatives at risk: If the pathogenic variant in the family is known and if prenatal testing has not been performed, it is appropriate to perform molecular genetic testing on at-risk newborns (males and females) as soon after birth as possible so that the appropriate treatment or surveillance (for those with the family-specific pathogenic variant) can be promptly established. If the pathogenic variant in the family is NOT known, biochemical analysis (plasma amino acid analysis, ammonia level), an allopurinol challenge test (in older individuals), and/or OTC enzyme activity measurement in liver (males only) can be performed. Preventive measures should be instituted at birth and maintained until the diagnosis has been ruled out. Pregnancy management: Heterozygous females are at risk of becoming catabolic during pregnancy and especially in the postpartum period. Those who are symptomatic need to be treated throughout pregnancy according to Transcarbamylase Deficiency 3 pre-pregnancy protocols adapted for needs during pregnancy; those who are asymptomatic need to avoid catabolism in the peripartum and postpartum periods and should be treated accordingly. Genetic counseling OTC deficiency is inherited in an X-linked manner. If the mother of a proband has an OTC pathogenic variant, the chance of transmitting it in each pregnancy is 50%. Males who inherit the pathogenic variant will be affected; females who inherit the pathogenic variant will be heterozygotes and may or may not develop clinical findings related to the disorder. Males with OTC deficiency transmit the pathogenic variant to all of their daughters and none of their sons. Molecular genetic heterozygote testing for at-risk female relatives and prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing for OTC deficiency are possible if the OTC pathogenic variant has been identified in the family."

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Untreated complete plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) deficiency is characterized by mild-to-moderate bleeding, although in some instances bleeding can be life-threatening. Most commonly, delayed bleeding is associated with injury, trauma, or surgery; spontaneous bleeding does not occur. While males and females with complete PAI-1 deficiency are affected equally, females may present more frequently with clinical manifestations or earlier in life than males due to menorrhagia and postpartum hemorrhage. Fewer than ten families with complete PAI-1 deficiency have been reported to date. The incidence of complete PAI-1 deficiency is higher than expected in the genetic isolate of the Old Order Amish population of eastern and southern Indiana due to a pathogenic founder variant. In one family from this Old Order Amish population, seven individuals were diagnosed to have cardiac fibrosis of varying degrees. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of complete PAI-1 deficiency is established in a proband when PAI-1 antigen is undetectable and PAI-1 activity is lower than 1 IU/mL and/or biallelic SERPINE1 pathogenic variants are identified on molecular genetic testing. Note that because the normal range of functional PAI-1 activity assay starts at zero in most laboratories, the ability to discriminate between normal and abnormal levels of activity is limited. Management Treatment of manifestations: Management of the bleeding disorder by a team of experts in the treatment of individuals with bleeding disorders is highly recommended. Intravenous antifibrinolytics (e.g., epsilon- aminocaproic acid [EACA] and tranexamic acid) can be used for severe bleeding manifestations, including intracranial hemorrhage (with or without hematoma evacuation).

GeneReviews needed to increase PAI-1 activity prior to achieving therapeutic steady-state levels of antifibrinolytics. Heavy menstrual bleeding can often be managed with oral antifibrinolytics or hormonal suppression therapy. Since there is no specific treatment of cardiac fibrosis, symptomatic treatment as needed. Prevention of primary manifestations: Antifibrinolytics should be used to prevent bleeding for surgical and dental procedures, childbirth, and other invasive procedures. Surveillance: Regular follow up with a team of experts in the treatment of individuals with bleeding disorders is recommended. For all individuals with complete PAI-1 deficiency, screening echocardiogram and EKG for assessment of cardiac function and cardiac MRI for quantification of fibrosis is recommended at diagnosis with close monitoring by a cardiologist based on the initial findings. The age of onset of cardiac fibrosis is unknown; therefore, an initial normal evaluation does not rule out the need for further surveillance. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Medications that affect coagulation including aspirin, ibuprofen, and some herbal remedies; high-risk activities such as contact sports. Evaluation of relatives at risk: It is appropriate to clarify the genetic status of apparently asymptomatic older and younger sibs of an individual with complete PAI-1 deficiency in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from prompt initiation of treatment and preventive measures. Pregnancy management: Recommendations based on published findings during pregnancies in two women with complete PAI-1 deficiency are oral administration of either tranexamic acid or EACA for intermittent bleeding in the first and second trimester, continuous administration from 26 weeks' gestation through delivery to prevent preterm labor, and for at least two weeks postpartum to prevent postpartum bleeding. Note: Evidence that these recommendations would be effective in all pregnancies of women with complete PAI-1 deficiency is lacking; the teratogenicity of EACA and tranexamic acid is unknown and information regarding their safety during pregnancy and lactation is limited. Genetic counseling Complete PAI-1 deficiency is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. If both parents are known to be heterozygous for a SERPINE1 pathogenic variant, each sib of an affected individual has at conception a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Once the SERPINE1 pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member, carrier testing for at-risk relatives, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk for complete PAI-1 deficiency, and preimplantation genetic testing are possible."

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics PAX2-related disorder is an autosomal dominant disorder associated with renal and eye abnormalities. The disorder was originally referred to as renal coloboma syndrome and characterized by renal hypodysplasia and abnormalities of the optic nerve; with improved access to molecular testing, a wider range of phenotypes has been recognized in association with pathogenic variants in PAX2. Abnormal renal structure or function is noted in 92% of affected individuals and ophthalmologic abnormalities in 77% of affected individuals. Renal abnormalities can be clinically silent in rare individuals. In most individuals, clinically significant renal insufficiency / renal failure is reported. End-stage renal disease requiring renal transplant is not uncommon. Uric acid nephrolithiasis has been reported. Ophthalmologic abnormalities are typically described as optic nerve coloboma or dysplasia. Iris colobomas have not been reported in any individual with PAX2related disorder. Ophthalmologic abnormalities may significantly impair vision in some individuals, while others have subtle changes only noted after detailed ophthalmologic examination. Additional clinical findings include high- frequency sensorineural hearing loss, soft skin, and ligamentous laxity. PAX2 pathogenic variants have been identified in multiple sporadic and familial cases of nonsyndromic renal disease including renal hypodysplasia and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of PAX2-related disorder is established in a proband with the characteristic renal and/or eye findings by the identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in PAX2 by molecular genetic testing. Among individuals with apparently nonsyndromic renal hypodysplasia and in families with autosomal dominant isolated focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, pathogenic variants in PAX2 have been identified in approximately 8% and 4%, respectively.

Prevention of secondary complications: Use of protective eyewear to prevent retinal detachment. Surveillance: Follow up by a nephrologist to monitor renal function and blood pressure and an ophthalmologist to monitor vision, with periodic audiometric evaluations. Evaluation of relatives at risk: Offer molecular genetic testing if a PAX2 pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member. If no PAX2 pathogenic variant has been found, perform dilated ophthalmologic examination, renal ultrasound examination, tests of renal function, uric acid levels, and urinalysis; measure blood pressure. Genetic counseling PAX2-related disorder is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Approximately 65% of probands with a documented PAX2 pathogenic variant have a negative family history. In such cases, the negative family history may be explained by a de novo pathogenic variant, unrecognized symptoms in the parents, or parental germline mosaicism for a PAX2 pathogenic variant. Both maternal and paternal germline mosaicism, with unaffected parents having more than one affected child with a pathogenic variant, have been reported. Prenatal testing and preimplantation genetic testing are possible if the pathogenic PAX2 pathogenic variant has been identified in the family."

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Hereditary paraganglioma-pheochromocytoma (PGL/PCC) syndromes are characterized by paragangliomas (tumors that arise from neuroendocrine tissues distributed along the paravertebral axis from the base of the skull to the pelvis) and pheochromocytomas (paragangliomas that are confined to the adrenal medulla). Sympathetic paragangliomas cause catecholamine excess; parasympathetic paragangliomas are most often nonsecretory. Extra-adrenal parasympathetic paragangliomas are located predominantly in the skull base and neck (referred to as head and neck paragangliomas [HNPGLs]) and sometimes in the upper mediastinum; approximately 95% of such tumors are nonsecretory. In contrast, extra-adrenal sympathetic paragangliomas are generally confined to the lower mediastinum, abdomen, and pelvis, and are typically secretory. Pheochromocytomas, which arise from the adrenal medulla, typically lead to catecholamine excess. Symptoms of PGL/PCCs result from either mass effects or catecholamine hypersecretion (e.g., sustained or paroxysmal elevations in blood pressure, headache, episodic profuse sweating, forceful palpitations, pallor, and apprehension or anxiety). The risk for developing metastatic disease is greater for extra-adrenal sympathetic paragangliomas than for pheochromocytomas. Additional tumors reported in individuals with hereditary PGL/PCC syndromes include gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), pulmonary chondromas, and clear cell renal cell carcinoma. Diagnosis/testing A diagnosis of a hereditary PGL/PCC syndrome is strongly suspected in an individual with multiple, multifocal, recurrent, or early-onset paraganglioma or pheochromocytoma and/or a family history of paraganglioma or pheochromocytoma.

GeneReviews paraganglioma or pheochromocytoma and a germline heterozygous pathogenic variant in MAX, SDHA, SDHAF2, SDHB, SDHC, SDHD, or TMEM127 identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: SDHB-related PGL/PCCs are typically treated with surgical resection because of the higher risk for metastatic disease. In general, most HNPGLs (carotid body, glomus jugulotympanicum, vagal, and jugular paragangliomas) are nonsecretory and may be treated with active observation, surgical resection, or radiation therapy. For secretory PGL/PCCs, alpha-adrenergic receptor blockade followed by surgical resection. All individuals with HNPGLs should be evaluated for catecholamine excess before surgical resection, which, if present, can suggest an additional primary PGL/PCC. Metastatic PGL/PCCs are treated with blood pressure control, surgical debulking, radiation therapy especially for bony lesions, liver-directed therapy, systemic chemotherapy, or radionuclide therapy. GIST treatment includes surgical resection and/or tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Clear cell renal cell carcinoma treatment is early surgical resection and standard treatments for metastatic disease. Surveillance: Individuals at risk for hereditary PGL/PCC syndromes should have annual clinical assessment for manifestations of PGL/PCCs and GISTs, plasma-free fractionated metanephrines or 24-hour urine fractionated metanephrines every two years in childhood and then annually in adults, and whole-body MRI every two to three years. Age of initiation for screening varies by gene. Consider endoscopic evaluation for GISTs in individuals with unexplained anemia and gastrointestinal symptoms. Agents/circumstances to avoid: As for all cancer predisposition syndromes, activities such as cigarette smoking that predispose to chronic lung disease should be discouraged. Hypoxic conditions (e.g., cyanotic heart disease, cigarette smoking) may increase tumor incidence and promote tumor growth, although data are extremely limited. Evaluation of relatives at risk: First-degree relatives of an individual with a hereditary PGL/PCC syndrome and a known MAX, SDHA, SDHAF2, SDHB, SDHC, SDHD, or TMEM127 pathogenic variant should be offered molecular genetic testing to clarify their genetic status to improve diagnostic certainty and reduce the need for costly screening procedures in those who have not inherited the pathogenic variant. Genetic counseling Hereditary PGL/PCC syndromes are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Most individuals diagnosed with a hereditary PGL/PCC syndrome inherited a PGL/PCC-related pathogenic variant from a parent; rarely, a proband with a hereditary PGL/PCC syndrome has the disorder as the result of a de novo pathogenic variant. Each child of an individual with a hereditary PGL/PCC syndrome-causing pathogenic variant has a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant. Pathogenic variants in SDHD, SDHAF2, and possibly MAX demonstrate parent-of-origin effects and cause disease almost exclusively when they are paternally inherited: an individual who inherits an SDHD or SDHAF2 pathogenic variant from the individual's father is at high risk of manifesting PGLs and PCCs; an individual who inherits an SDHD or SDHAF2 pathogenic variant from the individual's mother is usually not at risk of developing disease however, exceptions occur. Once the PGL/PCC syndrome- related pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, predictive molecular genetic testing for at-risk family members and prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing are possible."

While individual phenotypes (e.g., Zellweger syndrome [ZS], neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy [NALD], and infantile Refsum disease [IRD]) were described in the past before the biochemical and molecular bases of this spectrum were fully determined, the term \\\"ZSD\\\" is now used to refer to all individuals with a defect in one of the ZSD-PEX genes regardless of phenotype. Individuals with ZSD usually come to clinical attention in the newborn period or later in childhood. Affected newborns are hypotonic and feed poorly. They have distinctive facies, congenital malformations (neuronal migration defects associated with neonatal-onset seizures, renal cysts, and bony stippling [chondrodysplasia punctata] of the patella[e] and the long bones), and liver disease that can be severe. Infants with severe ZSD are significantly impaired and typically die during the first year of life, usually having made no developmental progress. Individuals with intermediate/milder ZSD do not have congenital malformations, but rather progressive peroxisome dysfunction variably manifest as sensory loss (secondary to retinal dystrophy and sensorineural hearing loss), neurologic involvement (ataxia, polyneuropathy, and leukodystrophy), liver dysfunction, adrenal insufficiency, and renal oxalate stones. While hypotonia and developmental delays are typical, intellect can be normal. Some have osteopenia; almost all have ameleogenesis imperfecta in the secondary teeth. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of ZSD is established in a proband with the suggestive clinical and biochemical findings above by identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in one of the 13 known ZSD-PEX genes.

Management Treatment of manifestations: The focus is on symptomatic therapy and may include gastrostomy to provide adequate calories, hearing aids, cataract removal, glasses to correct refractive errors, supplementation of fat- soluble vitamins, and cholic acid supplementation; varices can be treated with sclerosing therapies; anti-seizure medication, early intervention services for developmental delay and intellectual disability; adrenal replacement therapy; vitamin D supplementation and consideration of bisphosphonates for osteopenia; treatment as per dentist for ameliogenesis imperfecta. Supportive treatment for renal oxalate stones has included hydration, lithotripsy, and surgical intervention. Annual influenza and respiratory syncytial virus vaccines should be provided. Surveillance: Growth and nutrition should be assessed at each visit. Annual audiology and ophthalmologic evaluations; annual monitoring of liver function and coagulation factors, and ultrasound and/or fibroscan to evaluate liver architecture; monitor for changes in seizure activity; head MRI to evaluate for white matter changes that may explain changes in cognitive and/or motor ability; monitor developmental progress and educational needs; ACTH and cortisol levels by age one year and annually thereafter. Dental examinations every six months. Annual urine oxalate-to-creatinine ratio with consideration of renal imaging when performing liver imaging. Assessment of family needs at each visit. Genetic counseling ZSD is typically inherited in an autosomal recessive manner (one PEX6 variant, p.Arg860Trp, has been associated with ZSD in the heterozygous state). At conception, each sib of an individual with biallelic ZSD- causing pathogenic variants has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Carrier testing for at-risk relatives is possible if the pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member. Prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk is possible by DNA testing if both ZSD-related pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member, or by biochemical testing if the biochemical defects have been confirmed in cultured fibroblasts from an affected family member."

Diagnosis/testing PC is diagnosed by clinical findings and/or by the identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in one of the five keratin genes known to cause PC: KRT6A, KRT6B, KRT6C, KRT16, and KRT17. Management Treatment of manifestations: Pain from the palmoplantar keratoderma may be reduced somewhat by limiting friction and trauma to the feet by minimizing walking or standing, reducing hydration of the stratum corneum by using wicking socks and ventilated footwear, selecting comfortable shoes, and maintaining ideal body weight. Foot care includes paring down of hyperkeratotic areas and topical therapies for hyperkeratosis (emollients and lotions containing keratolyics). Care of thickened nails often requires the use of surgical or razor blades or sanders such as a Dremel tool. Troublesome nails removed surgically frequently grow back in some form. Good oral hygiene and brushing gently with a soft toothbrush can improve thick, white patches on the tongue and oral mucosa. Secondary fungal and bacterial infections that require treatment are common; cysts usually do not require treatment but can be incised and drained if infected or painful.

Three clinical phenotypes are recognized. Type A (infantile form) is characterized by infantile onset of metabolic and lactic acidosis, delayed motor development, intellectual disability, poor linear growth and/or weight gain, and neurologic findings (apathy, hypotonia, pyramidal and extrapyramidal signs, ataxia, and seizures). Brain anomalies can be noted. Most affected children die in infancy or early childhood. Type B (severe neonatal form) is characterized by neonatal or infantile onset of hypothermia, respiratory distress/ failure, vomiting, severe lactic acidosis, hyperammonemia, and often hypoglycemia. Neurologic findings include brain abnormalities, lethargy, hypotonia, and pyramidal and extrapyramidal signs. Death typically occurs by age eight months. Type C (intermittent/attenuated form) is characterized by relatively normal or mildly delayed neurologic development, motor and/or gait abnormalities, (rarely) seizures, episodic movement disorders, and metabolic acidosis.

Diagnosis/testing GeneReviews The diagnosis of PC deficiency is established in a proband whose newborn screening or biochemical findings suggest PC deficiency based on identification of either (1) biallelic pathogenic variants in PC on molecular genetic testing or (2) PC deficiency in whole blood. Management Treatment of manifestations: Intravenous glucose-containing fluids, hydration, and correction of metabolic acidosis; pharmacologic therapies (amino acid supplements, cofactors, and vitamins) may improve some findings but not neurologic manifestations; orthotopic liver transplantation may be indicated in some affected individuals; anaplerotic therapies, such as triheptanoin, have had variable success (primarily for individuals with PC deficiency type C) but need further evaluation. Surveillance: A team of multidisciplinary specialists is often required to monitor existing manifestations, the individual's response to treatment, and the emergence of new manifestations. Agents/circumstances to avoid: A ketogenic diet is contraindicated, and it is critical to avoid fasting. Evaluation of relatives at risk: It is appropriate to clarify the genetic and/or biochemical status of apparently asymptomatic older and younger at-risk sibs of an affected individual with PC deficiency type C in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from prompt initiation of treatment and preventive measures. Genetic counseling PC deficiency is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. If both parents are known to be heterozygous for a PC pathogenic variant, each sib of an affected individual has at conception a 25% chance of inheriting biallelic pathogenic variants and being affected, a 50% chance of inheriting one pathogenic variant and being heterozygous, and a 25% chance of inheriting neither of the familial PC pathogenic variants.

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy ALDH7A1 (PDE-ALDH7A1) is characterized by seizures not well controlled with anti-seizure medication that are responsive clinically and electrographically to large daily supplements of pyridoxine (vitamin B6). This is true across a phenotypic spectrum that ranges from classic to atypical PDE- ALDH7A1. Intellectual disability is common, particularly in classic PDE-ALDH7A1. In classic PDE-ALDH7A1, untreated seizures begin within the first weeks to months of life. Dramatic presentations of prolonged seizures and recurrent episodes of status epilepticus are typical; recurrent self-limited events including partial seizures, generalized seizures, atonic seizures, myoclonic events, and infantile spasms also occur. Electrographic seizures can occur without clinical correlates. In atypical PDE-ALDH7A1, findings in untreated individuals can include late-onset seizures beginning between late infancy and age three years, seizures that initially respond to anti-seizure medication and then become intractable, seizures during early life that do not respond to pyridoxine but are subsequently controlled with pyridoxine several months later, and prolonged seizure-free intervals (5 months) that occur after discontinuation of pyridoxine. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of PDE-ALDH7A1 is suspected in a proband with seizures responsive to pyridoxine administration and increased concentration of alpha-aminoadipic semialdehyde (-AASA) in urine and/or plasma. The diagnosis is established in a proband with suggestive clinical findings and biallelic pathogenic (or likely pathogenic) variants in ALDH7A1 identified by molecular genetic testing.

Copyright 1993-2024, University of Washington, Seattle. GeneReviews is a registered trademark of the University of Washington, Seattle. All rights reserved. Management GeneReviews Targeted therapies: Targeted therapy requires lifelong pharmacologic supplements of pyridoxine; the rarity of the disorder has precluded controlled studies to evaluate the optimal dose. The International PDE Consortium published clinical practice guidelines recommending pyridoxine doses by age (newborns: 100 mg/day; infants: 30 mg/kg/day with a maximum of 300 mg/day; children, adolescents, and adults: 30 mg/kg/day with a maximum of 500 mg/day) and dietary modifications targeted at reducing lysine intake. To prevent exacerbation of clinical seizures and/or encephalopathy during an acute illness, the daily dose of pyridoxine may be doubled for several days. Supportive care: Supportive care for developmental delay and/or intellectual disability follows standard practice. Prevention of secondary complications: Overuse of pyridoxine can cause a reversible sensory neuropathy. Surveillance: Recommendations to monitor existing manifestations, the individual's response to supportive care, and the emergence of new manifestations include regular assessments by the treating neurologist for control of epilepsy via targeted therapy with pyridoxine, need for concomitant use of anti-seizure medications, and signs of sensory neuropathy, as well as regular assessments of developmental progress and educational needs. Evaluation of relatives at risk: Prenatal molecular genetic testing of fetuses at risk may be performed to inform maternal pyridoxine supplementation during pregnancy and facilitate initiation of treatment at birth. If prenatal testing has not been performed on a pregnancy at risk, the neonate should receive therapeutic doses of pyridoxine until molecular genetic testing for the family-specific ALDH7A1 variants has been completed. Pregnancy management: Maternal supplemental pyridoxine at a dose of 50-100 mg/day throughout the last half of pregnancy and after birth may be considered if the fetus is known to be affected or, if diagnostic prenatal testing is not pursued, in an at-risk fetus and neonate until the diagnosis has been ruled out. Genetic counseling PDE-ALDH7A1 is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. If both parents are known to be heterozygous for an ALDH7A1 pathogenic variant, each sib of an affected individual has at conception a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Once the ALDH7A1 pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member, carrier testing for relatives at risk, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk, and preimplantation genetic testing for PDE- ALDH7A1 are possible."

The most common auditory symptoms are simple unformed sounds including humming, buzzing, or ringing; less common forms are distortions (e.g., volume changes) or complex sounds (e.g., specific songs or voices). Ictal receptive aphasia consists of a sudden onset of inability to understand language in the absence of general confusion. Less commonly, other ictal symptoms may occur, including sensory symptoms (visual, olfactory, vertiginous, or cephalic) or motor, psychic, and autonomic symptoms. Age at onset is usually in adolescence or early adulthood (age 10-30 years). The clinical course of ADEAF is benign. Seizures are usually well controlled after initiation of medical therapy. Diagnosis/testing The clinical diagnosis of ADEAF can be established in a proband with characteristic clinical features, normal brain imaging by MRI, and family history consistent with autosomal dominant inheritance. The molecular diagnosis is established in a proband with characteristic clinical features and a heterozygous pathogenic variant in LGI1, MICAL1, or RELN identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Seizure control is usually readily achieved with standard anti-seizure medications (ASM). Surveillance: Monitoring of epilepsy as clinically indicated; neurocognitive assessments in individuals suspected to have memory or attention deficits; evaluation by a psychiatrist for any psychiatric comorbidities. Evaluation of relatives at risk: Interviewing relatives at risk to identify those with suggestive findings may enable early treatment in those who develop seizures.

Offspring of an individual with ADEAF who is heterozygous for a pathogenic variant have a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant; the chance that offspring who inherit the pathogenic variant will manifest ADEAF ranges from 54% to 85% depending on the assumed penetrance.

PDS also includes development of euthyroid goiter in late childhood to early adulthood whereas NSEVA does not. Diagnosis/testing In at least 50% of probands with Pendred syndrome and/or NSEVA, the molecular diagnosis is established by identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in SLC26A4 or double heterozygosity for one pathogenic variant in SLC26A4 and one pathogenic variant in either FOXI1 or KCNJ10. The clinical diagnosis of Pendred syndrome is established in a proband with SNHL, characteristic temporal bone abnormalities identified on thin-cut CT, and euthyroid goiter. In comparison, the clinical diagnosis of nonsyndromic enlarged vestibular aqueduct (NSEVA) is established in a proband with SNHL and the temporal bone finding of enlargement of the vestibular aqueducts. It is important to note that in PDS, the temporal bone abnormality can include both EVA and cochlear hypoplasia, an anomaly in which the cochlea has only 1.5 turns instead of the expected 2.75 turns.

SNHL is bilateral and ranges from profound with prelingual (congenital) onset to moderate with early-childhood onset. When onset is in early childhood, hearing loss can be progressive. Ovarian dysfunction ranges from gonadal dysgenesis (absent or streak gonads) manifesting as primary amenorrhea to primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) defined as cessation of menses before age 40 years. Fertility in affected males is reported as normal (although the number of reported males is limited). Neurologic features described in some individuals with Perrault syndrome include learning difficulties and developmental delay, cerebellar ataxia, and motor and sensory peripheral neuropathy. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of Perrault syndrome is based on the clinical findings of SNHL in men and women and ovarian dysfunction in women with a 46,XX karyotype. The diagnosis is confirmed by the presence of biallelic pathogenic variants in one of six genes (CLPP, ERAL1, HARS2, HSD17B4, LARS2, or TWNK); however, in approximately 60% of individuals with Perrault syndrome identified to date, a molecular diagnosis cannot be established. Management Treatment of manifestations: Hearing loss should be assessed and treated by a multidisciplinary team including an audiologist and otolaryngologist.

Some individuals present with overlapping phenotypes (e.g., FTD-ALS, Perry syndrome-dHMN7B). Perry syndrome (the most common of the phenotypes associated with DCTN1) is characterized by parkinsonism, neuropsychiatric symptoms, hypoventilation, and weight loss. The mean age of onset in those with Perry syndrome is 49 years (range: 35-70 years), and the mean disease duration is five years (range: 2-14 years).

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics PIK3CA-related overgrowth spectrum (PROS) encompasses a range of clinical findings in which the core features are congenital or early-childhood onset of segmental/focal overgrowth with or without cellular dysplasia. Prior to the identification of PIK3CA as the causative gene, PROS was separated into distinct clinical syndromes based on the tissues and/or organs involved (e.g., MCAP [megalencephaly-capillary malformation] syndrome and CLOVES [congenital lipomatous asymmetric overgrowth of the trunk, lymphatic, capillary, venous, and combined-type vascular malformations, epidermal nevi, skeletal and spinal anomalies] syndrome). The predominant areas of overgrowth include the brain, limbs (including fingers and toes), trunk (including abdomen and chest), and face, all usually in an asymmetric distribution. Generalized brain overgrowth may be accompanied by secondary overgrowth of specific brain structures resulting in ventriculomegaly, a markedly thick corpus callosum, and cerebellar tonsillar ectopia with crowding of the posterior fossa. Vascular malformations may include capillary, venous, and less frequently, arterial or mixed (capillary-lymphatic-venous or arteriovenous) malformations. Lymphatic malformations may be in various locations (internal and/or external) and can cause various clinical issues, including swelling, pain, and occasionally localized bleeding secondary to trauma. Lipomatous overgrowth may occur ipsilateral or contralateral to a vascular malformation, if present. The degree of intellectual disability appears to be mostly related to the presence and severity of seizures, cortical dysplasia (e.g., polymicrogyria), and hydrocephalus. Many children have feeding difficulties that are often multifactorial in nature. Endocrine issues affect a small number of individuals and most commonly include hypoglycemia (largely hypoinsulinemic hypoketotic hypoglycemia), hypothyroidism, and growth hormone deficiency.

Copyright 1993-2024, University of Washington, Seattle. GeneReviews is a registered trademark of the University of Washington, Seattle. All rights reserved. Diagnosis/testing GeneReviews The diagnosis of PROS is established in a proband with suggestive findings and a heterozygous mosaic (or rarely, constitutional) activating pathogenic variant in PIK3CA. Sequence analysis of DNA derived from clinically affected tissue samples preferably from freshly obtained dermal biopsy overlying an affected area, from surgical excision of the overgrown tissue, or from uncultured tissues (such as skin fibroblasts or other tissues) should be prioritized for genetic testing. Targeted capture of the entire PIK3CA coding region followed by next-generation sequencing at very deep coverage is recommended for somatic variant detection, as it allows for detection of very low levels of mosaicism throughout the gene. Management Targeted therapy: Alpelisib (VIJOICE) 50 mg orally with food once a day (at about the same time every day) for those between age two years and <18 years with PROS. In those age six years or older, the dose may be increased to 125 mg once a day after 24 weeks. A starting dose of 250 mg orally with food once a day (at about the same time every day) has been approved for those age 18 years. Alpelisib has been approved specifically for the reduction of overgrowth, vascular lesions, and other functional complications. To date, it is unknown whether this drug has any efficacy in treating the neurologic manifestations of PROS (as, e.g., in MCAP syndrome). Supportive care: Significant or lipomatous segmental overgrowth may require debulking; scoliosis and leg-length discrepancy may require orthopedic care and surgical intervention. Neurologic complications (e.g., obstructive hydrocephalus, increased intracranial pressure, progressive and/or symptomatic cerebellar tonsillar ectopia or Chiari malformation, and epilepsy in those with brain overgrowth/malformations) may warrant neurosurgical intervention. Depending on the type of vascular malformations, sclerotherapy, laser therapy, or oral medications such as sirolimus may be used. Similarly, lymphatic malformations may be treated through oral medications or careful surgical debulking, preferably by a vascular anomalies team. For those with pain, evaluation for the source of pain and treatment of the underlying cause is recommended. For those with growth hormone deficiency, evaluation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis is warranted; a trial of growth hormone therapy may be considered with careful monitoring of linear growth and overgrowth. Severe persistent hypoglycemia has been reported, and requires evaluation and ongoing treatment, which can include cornstarch administration. Routine treatment of the following, when present, is indicated: cardiac and renal abnormalities; intellectual disabilities and behavior issues; polydactyly and foot deformities; coagulopathy or thrombosis; Wilms tumor; and hypothyroidism. Surveillance: At each visit: measurement of growth parameters including head circumference, length of arms, hands, legs, and feet; assess for new neurologic manifestations (seizures, changes in tone, and other signs/ symptoms of Chiari malformation); monitor developmental progress and behavior; assess motor skills; clinical assessment for scoliosis and abdominal examination for organomegaly and/or abdominal masses. Serial head MRI imagining is recommended, with frequency based on the severity of findings on initial assessment and the degree of brain maturation. For those with CNS overgrowth or dysplasia, brain MRI every six months until age two years and then annually until age eight years to monitor specifically for progressive hydrocephalus and Chiari malformation. As clinically indicated: clinical assessment and monitoring of any vascular and/or lymphatic malformations; radiographs of the limbs in those with overgrowth of a limb or portion of a limb; ultrasound or MRI follow up in those with truncal overgrowth; spinal MRI in those with scoliosis or deformities that affect the spine; blood glucose monitoring and evaluation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis for those with persistent hypoglycemia, particularly if they require ongoing treatment for hypoglycemia. Hematology consultation with recommendations for assessment for thrombosis and coagulopathy risk after any surgical intervention, particularly in those with the CLOVES phenotype and/or those with vascular malformations. Consideration of renal ultrasound every three months until age eight years (tumor screening for Wilms tumor is controversial). Overgrowth Spectrum 3 Genetic counseling PROS disorders are not known to be inherited, as most identified pathogenic variants are somatic (mosaic). No confirmed vertical transmission or sib recurrence has been reported to date. The risk to sibs of a proband with somatic mosaicism for a pathogenic variant in PIK3CA would be expected to be the same as in the general population. All but a few affected individuals with PROS have had somatic mosaicism for a PIK3CA pathogenic variant, suggesting that mutation occurred post fertilization in one cell of the multicellular embryo. Therefore, the risk for transmission to offspring is expected to be less than 50%."

PJS-type hamartomatous polyps are most common in the small intestine (in order of prevalence: jejunum, ileum, and duodenum) but can also occur in the stomach, large bowel, and extraintestinal sites including the renal pelvis, bronchus, gall bladder, nasal passages, urinary bladder, and ureters. GI polyps can result in chronic bleeding, anemia, and recurrent obstruction and intussusception requiring repeated laparotomy and bowel resection. Mucocutaneous hyperpigmentation presents in childhood as dark blue to dark brown macules around the mouth, eyes, and nostrils, in the perianal area, and on the buccal mucosa. Hyperpigmented macules on the fingers are common. The macules may fade in puberty and adulthood. Recognition of the distinctive skin manifestations is important especially in individuals who have PJS as the result of a de novo pathogenic variant as these skin findings often predate GI signs and symptoms. Individuals with PJS are at increased risk for a wide variety of epithelial malignancies (colorectal, gastric, pancreatic, breast, and ovarian cancers). Females are at risk for sex cord tumors with annular tubules (SCTAT), a benign neoplasm of the ovaries, and adenoma malignum of the cervix, a rare aggressive cancer. Males occasionally develop large calcifying Sertoli cell tumors of the testes, which secrete estrogen and can lead to gynecomastia, advanced skeletal age, and ultimately short stature, if untreated. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of PJS is based on clinical findings. Identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in STK11 by molecular genetic testing confirms the diagnosis and allows for testing of at-risk relatives.

GeneReviews capsule endoscopy (VCE), CT enterography, and/or magnetic resonance enterography (MRE). Balloon-assisted enteroscopy allows for removal of deep small-bowel polyps. Occasionally intraoperative enteroscopy and enterotomy is needed for removal of large distal small-bowel polyps. Intussusception and malignancies should be treated in the standard manner. Prevention of primary manifestations: Although not specifically studied in individuals with PJS, prophylactic mastectomy to decrease the risk of breast cancer could be considered based on family history or other clinical factors. Similarly, there is no prospective data on gynecologic prophylactic surgery for the elevated gynecologic cancer risk in females with PJS. Surveillance: In children and adolescents: colonoscopy and upper endoscopy at age eight years; if negative, follow up at age 18 years. If polyps are detected repeat every one to three years based on size, number, and histopathology of polyps. Small-bowel surveillance by MRE or VCE every one to three years beginning at age eight years. Examination for precocious puberty in females annually beginning at age eight years. Testicular examination and examination for feminizing changes in males annually beginning at age ten years. In adults: Colonoscopy, upper endoscopy, and small-bowel examination by MRE or VCE every two to three years beginning at age 18 years; clinical breast examination in women every six months beginning at age 30 years; mammogram and breast MRI in women annually beginning at age 30 years; pelvic examination and pap smear in women annually beginning at age 18 to 20 years. Pancreatic imaging with endoscopic ultrasound or MRI/MRCP annually beginning at age 30 to 35 years. Evaluation of relatives at risk: If the pathogenic variant in the family is known, offer molecular genetic testing to at-risk relatives so that morbidity and mortality can be reduced by early diagnosis and prevention of disease through appropriate surveillance and consideration of prophylactic measures in affected family members. If the family variant is not known, offer clinical diagnostic evaluations to all at-risk family members, who will benefit from early treatment and appropriate surveillance. Genetic counseling PJS is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. The majority of individuals diagnosed with PJS have an affected parent; however, many individuals with PJS represent apparently simplex cases. The exact proportion of individuals who have PJS as the result of a de novo pathogenic variant is unknown. If a parent of the proband is affected and/or is known to have the STK11 pathogenic variant identified in the proband, the risk to the sibs of inheriting the pathogenic variant is 50%. Once the STK11 pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, predictive testing for at-risk family members, prenatal testing, and preimplantation genetic testing are possible."

The phenotypic spectrum of PKAN includes classic PKAN and atypical PKAN. Classic PKAN is characterized by early-childhood onset of progressive dystonia, dysarthria, rigidity, and choreoathetosis. Pigmentary retinal degeneration is common. Atypical PKAN is characterized by later onset (age >10 years), prominent speech defects, psychiatric disturbances, and more gradual progression of disease. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of PKAN is established in a proband with the characteristic clinical features and the \\\"eye of the tiger\\\" sign identified on brain MRI (a central region of hyperintensity surrounded by a rim of hypointensity on coronal or transverse T2-weighted images of the globus pallidus). Identification of biallelic PANK2 pathogenic variants on molecular genetic testing confirms the diagnosis. Management Treatment of manifestations: Intramuscular botulinum toxin, ablative pallidotomy or thalmotomy, intrathecal or oral baclofen, oral trihexyphenidyl, deep brain stimulation, physical therapy and occupational therapy to maintain joint mobility, referral for adaptive aids (walker, wheelchair) for gait abnormalities, speech therapy and/or assistive communication devices, treatment for retinopathy by ophthalmology, referral to community resources: financial services, services for the blind, and educational programs. Prevention of secondary complications: Full-mouth dental extraction when severe orobuccolingual dystonia results in recurrent tongue biting; gastrostomy tube feeding as needed.

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is generally a late-onset multisystem disorder characterized by bilateral kidney cysts, liver cysts, and an increased risk of intracranial aneurysms. Other manifestations include: cysts in the pancreas, seminal vesicles, and arachnoid membrane; dilatation of the aortic root and dissection of the thoracic aorta; mitral valve prolapse; and abdominal wall hernias. Kidney manifestations include early-onset hypertension, kidney pain, and kidney insufficiency. Approximately 50% of individuals with ADPKD have end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) by age 60 years. The prevalence of liver cysts increases with age and occasionally results in clinically significant severe polycystic liver disease (PLD), most often in females. Overall, the prevalence of intracranial aneurysms is fivefold higher than in the general population and further increased in those with a positive family history of aneurysms or subarachnoid hemorrhage. There is substantial variability in the severity of kidney disease and other extra-kidney manifestations. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of ADPKD is established in a proband with age-specific kidney imaging criteria and either an affected first-degree relative with ADPKD or a heterozygous pathogenic variant in PKD1, PKD2, or one of the less common associated genes (ALG5, ALG9, DNAJB11, GANAB, IFT140) identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Treatment with vasopressin V2 receptor antagonists (e.g., tolvaptan) to slow disease progression is approved for individuals with rapidly progressive disease. Treatment for hypertension may include ACE inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers and diet modification. Delayed onset of ESKD has been suggested with lipid control; low osmolar intake (e.g., moderate sodium and protein); increased hydration by moderate water intake; maintenance of sodium bicarbonate 22 mEq/L; moderation of dietary phosphorus Author Affiliation: 1 Division of Nephrology and Hypertension, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota; Email: harris.peter@mayo.edu; Email: torres.vicente@mayo.edu.

GeneReviews intake; moderation of caloric intake; and low-impact exercise to maintain normal body mass index. Conservative treatment of flank pain includes nonopioid agents, tricyclic antidepressants, narcotic analgesics, and splanchnic nerve blockade. More aggressive treatments include cyst decompression with cyst aspiration and sclerosis, laparoscopic or surgical cyst fenestration, kidney denervation, and nephrectomy. Cyst hemorrhage and/or gross hematuria usually responds to bed rest, analgesics, and adequate hydration. Severe bleeding may require transfusion, segmental arterial embolization, or surgery. Treatment of nephrolithiasis is standard. Treatment of cyst infections is difficult, with a high failure rate. Therapeutic agents of choice include trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, fluoroquinolones, clindamycin, vancomycin, and metronidazole. ESKD is treated with dialysis and transplantation. Symptomatic liver cysts may improve with avoidance of estrogens and the use of H2 blockers or proton pump inhibitors. Severe symptoms may require percutaneous aspiration and sclerosis, laparoscopic fenestration, combined hepatic resection and cyst fenestration, liver transplantation, or selective hepatic artery embolization. The mainstay of therapy for ruptured or symptomatic intracranial aneurysm is surgical clipping of the ruptured aneurysm at its neck; however, for some individuals, endovascular treatment with detachable platinum coils may be indicated. Thoracic aortic replacement is indicated when the aortic root diameter reaches 55-60 mm. Surveillance: CT or MRI examination of the abdomen with and without contrast enhancement every one to five years in adults depending on disease stage; blood pressure monitoring every three years beginning at age five years in those with normal blood pressure; urine studies for microalbuminuria or proteinuria every one to five years in adults depending on disease stage; echocardiography or chest MRI every two to three years in adults with a first-degree relative with thoracic aortic dissection; MRA examination for intracranial aneurysms in adults determined to be at high risk. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Long-term administration of nephrotoxic agents, high levels of caffeine, high-salt diet, smoking, and obesity, and in individuals with severe PLD, use of estrogens and possibly progestogens. Evaluation of relatives at risk: Testing of adult relatives at risk permits early diagnosis, initiation of treatment, and treatment of associated complications. Pregnancy management: Pregnant women with ADPKD should be monitored for the development of hypertension, urinary tract infections, oligohydramnios, and preeclampsia; the fetus should be monitored for intrauterine fetal growth restriction, oligohydramnios, and fetal kidney anomalies including cysts, enlarged size, and atypical echogenicity. Genetic counseling In most affected families, ADPKD is caused by a heterozygous PKD1 or PKD2 pathogenic variant and inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. More rarely, ADPKD is caused by a heterozygous pathogenic variant in ALG5, ALG9, DNAJB11, GANAB, or IFT140. Complex inheritance (biallelic PKD1- or PKD2-related ADPKD or digenic ADPKD) may play a role in a minority of families and is important when considering the risk to other family members. Most individuals diagnosed with ADPKD have an affected parent; 10%-20% of affected individuals have the disorder as the result of a de novo pathogenic variant. Each child of an individual who is heterozygous for an ADPKD-causing pathogenic variant has a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant. Once the ADPKD-causing pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing are possible."

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease PKHD1 (ARPKD-PKHD1) is characterized by primary involvement of the kidneys and liver with mostly secondary effects seen in other organ systems. Of the three ages of initial presentation of kidney disease, the two most common are perinatal (i.e., prenatal/neonatal) and infantile (four weeks to age one year) with the classic finding of enlarged kidneys. The major difference between the perinatal and infantile presentations, which typically have similar kidney and liver findings, is the frequent occurrence of pulmonary involvement in the perinatal presentation, which is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in neonates. The less common initial presentation in childhood (after age one year) to young adulthood can be associated with predominant hepatobiliary manifestations characterized by the clinical consequences of developmental anomalies of biliary ductal plate remodeling (also known as Caroli disease). Although the short-term and long-term mortality rates of ARPKD remain significant, the survival of individuals with ARPKD has improved with modern neonatal respiratory support, kidney replacement therapy (KRT) including dialysis and kidney transplantation (KTx), and liver transplantation (LTx) or combined liver and kidney transplantation (CLKTx).

Diagnosis/testing GeneReviews The molecular diagnosis of ARPKD-PKHD1 is established in a proband with suggestive findings and biallelic pathogenic variants in PKHD1 identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Multidisciplinary care including (1) kidney disease and nutrition specialists to ensure optimal metabolic control and growth and timely institution of KRT; (2) hepatobiliary disease specialists to assure timely management of complications (that can include ascending cholangitis, cholestasis, and portal hypertension) and LTx/CLKTx; and (3) psychologists and social workers for ongoing family support. Surveillance: Regularly scheduled follow up as specified by the treating multidisciplinary specialists. Agents/circumstances to avoid: High-salt diet, smoking, obesity, and sympathomimetic agents (especially individuals who have hypertension). Minimizing use of known nephrotoxic agents including nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and aminoglycosides (unless otherwise advised) and of potentially hepatotoxic agents (e.g., acetaminophen doses >30 mg/kg/day, herbal supplements, and alcohol) is advised. Evaluation of relatives at risk: Early screening and genetic testing of apparently asymptomatic at-risk sibs can be considered with the goal of identifying those who may benefit from additional examinations and potentially preventive measures. Ultrasonography of the parents of children with ARPKD-PKHD1 is warranted (1) to confirm the clinical diagnosis and (2) because individuals heterozygous for a PKHD1 pathogenic variant may, in rare instances, have very mild cystic kidney manifestations or, more frequently, liver cysts. Genetic counseling ARPKD-PKHD1 is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. If both parents are known to be heterozygous for a PKHD1 pathogenic variant, each sib of an affected individual has at conception a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being heterozygous, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Heterozygotes for a PKHD1 pathogenic variant are not at risk of developing ARPKD-PKHD1; however, hyperechogenicity in the kidneys with mild kidney cysts as well as hepatic cysts have been described in individuals with monoallelic PKHD1 pathogenic variants. Once the PKHD1 pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member, carrier testing for at-risk relatives and molecular genetic prenatal testing and preimplantation genetic testing are possible."

Clinical characteristics Familial paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia (referred to as familial PKD in this entry) is characterized by unilateral or bilateral involuntary movements precipitated by other sudden movements such as standing up from a sitting position, being startled, or changes in velocity; attacks include combinations of dystonia, choreoathetosis, and ballism, are sometimes preceded by an aura, and do not involve loss of consciousness. Attacks can be as frequent as 100 per day to as few as one per month. Attacks are usually a few seconds to five minutes in duration but can last several hours. Age of onset, severity and combinations of symptoms vary. Age of onset, typically in childhood and adolescence, ranges from four months to 57 years. The phenotype of PKD can include benign familial infantile epilepsy (BFIE), infantile convulsions and choreoathetosis (ICCA), hemiplegic migraine, migraine with and without aura, and episodic ataxia. Familial PKD is predominantly seen in males. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of familial PKD is based on the clinical findings of attacks of dystonia, chorea, ballismus, or athetosis triggered by sudden movements that occur many times per day and can be prevented or reduced in frequency by phenytoin or carbamezepine. Heterozygous pathogenic variants in PRRT2 have been reported as causative of a subset of cases of familial PKD. The other gene(s) associated with PKD have not been identified. Management Treatment of manifestations: Attack frequency is reduced or prevented by the anticonvulsants phenytoin or carbamezepine, typically given at lower doses than are used to treat epilepsy. Other effective anticonvulsants include oxcarbazepine, ethosuximide, and lamotrigine.

The risk of adverse outcome varies based on the degree of PAH deficiency. Without effective therapy, most individuals with severe PAH deficiency, known as classic PKU, develop profound and irreversible intellectual disability. Affected individuals on an unrestricted diet who have phenylalanine levels above normal but below 1,200 mol/L (20 mg/dL) are at much lower risk for impaired cognitive development in the absence of treatment. Diagnosis/testing PAH deficiency can be detected by newborn screening in virtually 100% of cases based on the presence of hyperphenylalaninemia using tandem mass spectrometry on a blood spot obtained from a heel prick. The diagnosis of PAH deficiency is established in a proband with: A plasma phenylalanine concentration persistently above 120 mol/L (2 mg/dL) and altered ratio of phenylalanine to tyrosine in the untreated state with normal BH4 cofactor metabolism; and/or The finding of biallelic pathogenic variants in PAH by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Classic PKU: a low-protein diet and use of a Phe-free medical formula as soon as possible after birth to achieve plasma Phe concentrations of 120-360 mol/L (2-6 mg/dL). A proportion of individuals with PKU benefit from adjuvant therapy with sapropterin.

Agents/circumstances to avoid: Aspartame, an artificial sweetener that contains phenylalanine. Evaluation of relatives at risk: Newborn sibs of an individual with PAH deficiency who have not been tested prenatally should have blood concentration of Phe measured shortly after birth (in addition to newborn screening) to allow earliest possible diagnosis and treatment. Pregnancy management: To minimize or prevent teratogenic effects of phenylalanine, women with PAH deficiency should follow a Phe-restricted diet for at least several months prior to conception in order to maintain plasma Phe concentrations between 120 and 360 mol/L (2-6 mg/dL); after conception, continuous nutritional guidance and weekly or biweekly measurement of plasma Phe concentration to assure that target levels are met in addition to adequate energy intake with the proper proportion of protein, fat, and carbohydrates.

The clinical course of PLOSL can be divided into four stages: 1. The latent stage is characterized by normal early development. 2. The osseous stage (3rd decade of life) is characterized by pain and tenderness, mostly in ankles and feet, usually following strain or injury. Fractures are typically diagnosed several years later, most commonly in the bones of the extremities. In the early neurologic stage (4th decade of life), a change of personality begins to develop insidiously. Affected individuals show a frontal lobe syndrome (loss of judgment, euphoria, loss of social inhibitions, disturbance of concentration, and lack of insight, libido, and motor persistence) leading to serious social issues. 3. 4. The late neurologic stage is characterized by progressive dementia and loss of mobility. Death usually occurs before age 50 years.

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics PLPBP deficiency is a treatable form of vitamin B6-dependent early-onset epileptic encephalopathy. Seizure onset is typically in the neonatal period (i.e., within the first 28 days after birth), and rarely in childhood after the neonatal period. Seizures are unresponsive to (or only partly responsive to) anti-seizure medications (ASMs) but typically show an immediate positive response to vitamin B6, given as either pyridoxine (PN) or pyridoxal 5'- phosphate (PLP). This therapy needs to be continued lifelong. In addition to vitamin B6 treatment, almost 60% of individuals require adjunct ASMs to achieve optimal seizure control. Although many individuals with PLPBP deficiency have normal motor, speech, and intellectual development, more than 50% have varying degrees of neurodevelopmental issues, including learning difficulties or intellectual disability (varying from mild to severe), delayed or absent speech development, or motor development abnormalities (most commonly mild hypotonia). Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of PLPBP deficiency is established in a proband with suggestive findings and biallelic pathogenic variants in PLPBP identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Targeted therapies: There is no cure for PLPBP deficiency. Targeted therapy is lifelong pharmacologic treatment with either PN or PLP, and often with additional ASMs. Author Affiliations: 1 Centre for Molecular Medicine and Therapeutics, BC Children's Hospital Research Institute, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada; Email: halshekaili@bcchr.ca. 2 Department of Genetics, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, the Netherlands; Email: j.ciapaite@umcutrecht.nl. 3 Departments of Pediatrics and Human Genetics, Emma Center for Personalized Medicine, Amsterdam University Medical Centers, Amsterdam, the Netherlands; Email: c.d.vankarnebeek@amsterdamumc.nl. 4 Scientist, CHEO Research Institute; Assistant Professor, Faculty of Medicine, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Canada; Email: ipena@cheo.on.ca.

GeneReviews Supportive care: Supportive care for neurodevelopmental issues typically includes specialists in multiple disciplines including neurology, developmental pediatrics, speech-language therapy, physical therapy, and occupational therapy. Surveillance: Regular examination by treating specialists is necessary to monitor existing manifestations, the individual's response to pharmacologic treatment and supportive care, and the emergence of new manifestations. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Several ASMs (such as carbamazepine, valproate, phenytoin, and phenobarbitone) can cause a low plasma concentration of PLP. Evaluation of relatives at risk: If the PLPBP pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member, prenatal molecular genetic testing may be performed via amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling in future pregnancies at risk in order to facilitate postnatal treatment of the newborn. When prenatal testing has not been performed on a pregnancy at risk, prompt diagnostic evaluation of the newborn is essential. While results of molecular genetic testing are pending, the options for management are either: (1) treatment with PN or PLP (whichever was effective in the affected sib); or (2) clinical and EEG monitoring with initiation of PN or PLP (whichever was effective in the affected sib) at the first sign of seizures or encephalopathy.

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics PLP1 disorders of central nervous system myelin formation include a range of phenotypes from Pelizaeus- Merzbacher disease (PMD) to spastic paraplegia 2 (SPG2). PMD typically manifests in infancy or early childhood with nystagmus, hypotonia, and cognitive impairment; the findings progress to severe spasticity and ataxia. Life span is shortened. SPG2 manifests as spastic paraparesis with or without CNS involvement and usually normal life span. Intrafamilial variation of phenotypes can be observed, but the signs are usually fairly consistent within families. Heterozygous females may manifest mild-to-moderate signs of the disease. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of a PLP1 disorder is established in a male proband by identification of a hemizygous pathogenic variant involving PLP1. The diagnosis of a PLP1 disorder is usually established in a female with neurologic signs, a family history of a PLP1 disorder, and a heterozygous pathogenic variant in PLP1 identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: A multidisciplinary team comprising specialists in neurology, physical medicine, orthopedics, pulmonary medicine, and gastroenterology is optimal for care. Treatment may include gastrostomy for individuals with severe dysphagia; anti-seizure medication for seizures; and routine management of spasticity including physical therapy, exercise, medications (baclofen, diazepam, tizanidine), orthotics, and surgery for joint contractures. Individuals with scoliosis benefit from proper wheelchair seating and physical therapy; surgery may be required for severe scoliosis.

Surveillance: Semiannual to annual neurologic and physical medicine evaluations during childhood to monitor developmental progress, spasticity, and orthopedic complications. Genetic counseling PLP1 disorders are inherited in an X-linked manner. De novo pathogenic variants have been reported. If the mother has a PLP1 pathogenic variant, the chance of transmitting the variant in each pregnancy is 50%. Males who inherit the variant will be affected; females who inherit the variant may manifest mild-to- moderate signs of the disorder. (PLP1 alleles that cause relatively mild neurologic signs in affected males are more likely to be associated with neurologic manifestations in heterozygous females.) Males with the PMD phenotype do not reproduce; males with SPG2 phenotype transmit the PLP1 pathogenic variant to all of their daughters and none of their sons. Prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk is possible if the PLP1 pathogenic variant in the family is known."

Over time the hypotonia typically evolves into spasticity that affects the ability to walk and communicate. Cerebellar signs (gait ataxia, dysmetria, intention tremor, head titubation, and dysdiadochokinesia) frequently manifest during childhood. Some individuals develop extrapyramidal movement abnormalities (choreoathetosis and dystonia). Hearing loss and optic atrophy are observed in rare cases. Motor impairments can lead to swallowing difficulty and orthopedic complications, including hip dislocation and scoliosis. Most individuals have normal cognitive skills or mild intellectual disability which, however, can be difficult to evaluate in the context of profound motor impairment.

Attacks are typically precipitated by coffee, tea, or alcohol; they can also be triggered by excitement, stress, or fatigue, or can be spontaneous. Attacks involve dystonic posturing with choreic and ballistic movements, may be accompanied by a preceding aura, occur while the individual is awake, and are not associated with seizures. Attacks last minutes to hours and rarely occur more than once per day. Attack frequency, duration, severity, and combinations of symptoms vary within and among families. Age of onset is typically in childhood or early teens but can be as late as age 50 years. Diagnosis/testing The clinical diagnosis of familial PNKD is suspected in a proband who presents with attacks of dystonia, chorea, and/or ballismus typically provoked by alcohol or caffeine. Identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in PNKD by molecular genetic testing confirms the diagnosis.

The hypogonadotropic hypogonadism occurs either in isolation or as part of anterior hypopituitarism (growth hormone, thyroid hormone, or gonadotropin deficiencies). Common but less frequent features are peripheral neuropathy (usually of axonal type manifesting as reduced distal reflexes, diminished vibratory sensation, and/or distal muscle wasting); hair anomalies (long eyelashes, bushy eyebrows, or scalp alopecia); short stature; and impaired cognitive functioning (learning disabilities in children; deficits in attention, visuospatial abilities, and recall in adults). Some of these features can occur in distinct clusters on the phenotypic continuum: Boucher-Neuhuser syndrome (cerebellar ataxia, chorioretinal dystrophy, and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism); Gordon Holmes syndrome (cerebellar ataxia, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, and to a variable degree brisk reflexes); Oliver-McFarlane syndrome (trichomegaly, chorioretinal dystrophy, short stature, intellectual disability, and hypopituitarism); Laurence- Moon syndrome; and spastic paraplegia type 39 (SPG39) (upper motor neuron involvement, peripheral neuropathy, and sometimes reduced cognitive functioning and/or cerebellar ataxia).

In classic PNPO deficiency, seizures (including status epilepticus) often begin on the first day of life and typically before age two weeks. In both classic and late-onset untreated PNPO deficiency, seizure semiology varies from myoclonic to clonic or tonic seizures, and seizures are typically resistant to common anti-seizure medications. Independent of age of onset, seizures respond to life-long treatment with a B6 vitamer: pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) in about 60% of affected individuals and pyridoxine (PN) in about 40%. About 60% of individuals with PNPO deficiency have developmental impairment, affecting speech, cognition, and behavior; some individuals have neurologic impairment such as muscular hypotonia or dystonia. Severe neurodevelopmental impairment is more likely to occur in individuals with PNPO deficiency who experienced diagnostic delay and prolonged periods of uncontrolled seizures. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of PNPO deficiency is established in a proband with suggestive findings (i.e., infantile onset of a wide range of seizure types resistant to common anti-seizure medications and a positive standardized vitamin B6 trial) and (most commonly) biallelic pathogenic variants in PNPO identified by molecular genetic testing or deficient PNPO enzyme activity.

Supportive care: Supportive care often includes specialists from multiple disciplines such as neurology, developmental pediatrics, speech-language therapy, physical therapy, occupational therapy, and mental health. Surveillance: Routine monitoring of seizure control and possible adverse effects of PLP therapy; neurologic examination for emergence of new findings and/or response to medications used in symptomatic treatment; and assessment of development/educational needs. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Avoid anti-seizure medications (such as carbamazepine, valproate, phenytoin, and phenobarbital) that can reduce plasma PLP concentration. Attention to PLP dose requirements when hydrazines or isoniazid are given to treat other conditions. Evaluation of relatives at risk: When prenatal testing has not been performed on a pregnancy at risk, prompt evaluation of a newborn sib is essential to determine if treatment with either PN or PLP is necessary. Pregnancy management: Although empiric data on the utility of maternal PN supplementation during pregnancy for a fetus known to have or be at risk for PNPO deficiency are limited, consider giving 50-100 mg/day of PN to the mother during the last 20 weeks of pregnancy. PN (not PLP) supplementation is recommended for two reasons: the mother has the capacity to metabolize PN into PLP, and the risk of PLP hepatotoxicity in pregnancy is unknown. Genetic counseling PNPO deficiency is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. If both parents are known to be heterozygous for a PNPO pathogenic variant, each sib of an affected individual, irrespective of sex, has at conception a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier.

There is increased risk for myelodysplastic syndrome, acute myelogenous leukemia, and skin cancer. Other ectodermal findings include thickened nails, nail dystrophy, and palmar/plantar hyperkeratosis. Most affected individuals also have reactive airway disease, and some have short stature, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, midfacial retrusion, calcinosis cutis, and non-healing skin ulcers. Diagnosis/testing Often the diagnosis of PN can be established in a proband based on clinical findings (post-inflammatory poikiloderma and congenital chronic neutropenia). Unequivocal confirmation of the diagnosis of PN relies on detection of biallelic USB1 pathogenic variants by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Dermatologic manifestations are treated with gentle skin care using bland emollients. Diligent sun protection with both UVA and UVB protection and/or sun-protective clothing to reduce the risk of skin cancer. Very pruritic palmar/plantar hyperkeratosis can be treated with a strong topical steroid or a topical keratolytic if secondary dermatophyte infection has been ruled out. Although use of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor increases the absolute neutrophil count, there is little evidence of decreased frequency of infections with this treatment.

Clinical characteristics Proopiomelanocortin (POMC) deficiency is characterized by severe, early-onset hyperphagic obesity and congenital adrenal insufficiency, the latter secondary to corticotropin (ACTH) deficiency. In the first months of life most children with POMC deficiency experience exponential weight gain, hyperphagia, cholestasis, and adrenal insufficiency. Weight gain continues rapidly, so that by the end of the first year of life obesity is severe (i.e., weight well above the 98th centile for age, without increased height). Red hair and Fitzpatrick type 1 skin (which always burns and never tans) are common, but not invariably present. On occasion central hypothyroidism (resulting from thyroid stimulating hormone [TSH] deficiency), adolescent-onset growth hormone (GH) deficiency, and adolescent-onset hypogonadotropic hypogonadism resulting from deficiency of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicule stimulating hormone (FSH) can be observed. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of POMC deficiency is confirmed by the presence of biallelic POMC pathogenic variants. Management Treatment of manifestations: Neonatal adrenal insufficiency is treated in the usual manner with hydrocortisone replacement therapy. No effective medical therapy for hyperphagic obesity is known; thus, lifestyle measures are necessary to control weight gain. Skin care relies on avoiding sun exposure in the middle four hours of the day (i.e., 10 am 2 pm), cover-up clothing, and high-factor sunscreen.

GH deficiency and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism are treated in the usual manner. Prevention of primary manifestations: Prompt treatment of ACTH, TSH, GH, LH, and FSH deficiency prevents the consequences of these hormone deficiencies. Surveillance: From the time of diagnosis, annual monitoring for deficiencies of TSH, GH, LH, and FSH. Surveillance of skin for premalignant lesions may be necessary depending on latitude and history of sun exposure. Malignant skin lesions have not specifically been reported to be associated with POMC deficiency, though a theoretic risk is assumed to exist. Evaluation of relatives at risk: If the POMC pathogenic variants in the family are known, prenatal testing can clarify the genetic status of at-risk pregnancies so that glucocorticoid therapy can be initiated as soon as possible after birth in those infants known to have POMC deficiency. If POMC deficiency has been previously diagnosed in a family and if the POMC pathogenic variants in the family are not known or if prenatal testing has not been performed, it is necessary to evaluate any at-risk newborns (e.g., sibs of a proband) for evidence of adrenal insufficiency and to initiate glucocorticoid therapy as soon as possible.

Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of F-PCT is established in a proband with elevated porphyrins in the urine (predominantly uroporphyrin and heptacarboxylporphyrin) and a heterozygous pathogenic variant in UROD identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: No treatment regimens can restore UROD enzyme levels in individuals with F-PCT. The mainstays of therapy are reduction of body iron stores and liver iron content, and use of low-dose antimalarial agents (hydroxychloroquine). In addition, modifiable risk factors can be addressed by ceasing alcohol/tobacco use, modifying estrogen use, and treating hepatitis C infection (if present).

Agents/circumstances to avoid: Susceptibility factors (e.g., iron supplements, alcohol consumption, smoking, estrogen use, and hepatotoxins); exposure to sunlight in the symptomatic phase. Evaluation of relatives at risk: If the family-specific UROD pathogenic variant is known, it is reasonable to clarify the genetic status of at-risk relatives so that those with a UROD pathogenic variant can avoid known susceptibility factors. Genetic counseling F-PCT is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner with reduced penetrance. Most individuals diagnosed with F-PCT inherited a UROD pathogenic variant from a heterozygous, asymptomatic parent. Each child of an individual with F-PCT has a 50% chance of inheriting the UROD pathogenic variant; because the penetrance of F-PCT is low, the likelihood of offspring developing signs and symptoms of PCT is small. Once the UROD pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible. However, because of the low penetrance of F- PCT, the results of prenatal testing are not useful in accurately predicting whether an individual with one UROD pathogenic variant will develop clinical manifestations of PCT."

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Variegate porphyria (VP) is both a cutaneous porphyria (with chronic blistering skin lesions) and an acute porphyria (with severe episodic neurovisceral symptoms). The most common manifestation of VP is adult-onset cutaneous blistering lesions (subepidermal vesicles, bullae, and erosions that crust over and heal slowly) of sun- exposed skin, especially the hands and face. Other chronic skin findings include milia, scarring, thickening, and areas of decreased and increased skin pigmentation. Facial hyperpigmentation and hypertrichosis may occur. Cutaneous manifestations may improve in winter and be less prevalent in northern regions and in dark-skinned individuals. Acute neurovisceral symptoms can occur any time after puberty, but less often in the elderly. Acute manifestations are highly variable, but may be similar from episode to episode in a person with recurrent attacks; not all manifestations are present in a single episode; and acute symptoms may become chronic. Symptoms are more common in women than men. The most common manifestations are abdominal pain; constipation; pain in the back, chest, and extremities; anxiety; seizures; and a primarily motor neuropathy resulting in muscle weakness that may progress to quadriparesis and respiratory paralysis. Psychiatric disturbances and autonomic neuropathy can also be observed. Acute attacks may be severe and are potentially fatal. Diagnosis/testing The biochemical diagnosis of VP is established in an individual with elevated urine porphobilinogen (PBG) or porphyrins and a fluorescence peak at ~626 nm on plasma fluorescence scanning; fecal porphyrins are also elevated, with a predominance of coproporphyrin III and protoporphyrin. The molecular diagnosis of VP is established by identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in PPOX on molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: The first step in treating either acute neurovisceral attacks or cutaneous manifestations is to identify and remove exacerbating factors (see Agents/circumstances to avoid). Most acute Author Affiliations: 1 University of South Dakota Sanford School of Medicine Sioux Falls, South Dakota; Email: aksingal@uab.edu. 2 University of Texas Medical Branch Galveston, Texas; Email: kanderso@utmb.edu.

GeneReviews neurovisceral attacks require hospital admission; the presence of seizures, motor neuropathy, and hyponatremia suggest severe disease that ideally should be managed in an ICU. Narcotic analgesics are usually required for pain. Ondansetron or a related drug can be used for nausea and vomiting; phenothiazines can be effective for nausea, agitation, and hallucinations. Although mild attacks (without seizures, weakness, or hyponatremia and not requiring narcotics) can sometimes be treated in an outpatient setting with glucose loading, most attacks require treatment with intravenous hemin and in-patient observation for additional supportive management. Cutaneous manifestations are best managed by wearing protective clothing and avoiding exposure to sunlight. Symptoms may decrease when exacerbating factors are removed. No treatment is known to be effective in lowering porphyrin levels and reducing cutaneous symptoms. Analgesics may be needed for painful lesions and antibiotics for superimposed infection. Prevention of primary manifestations: Acute neurovisceral attacks are less likely to occur if exacerbating factors are corrected or avoided. Recurrent premenstrual acute attacks can be prevented with gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogs; weekly or biweekly hemin infusions to prevent frequent noncyclical attacks may be effective, but experience is lacking. Prevention of the skin manifestations requires protection from sunlight. Surveillance: Liver imaging at six-month intervals beginning at age 50 years in those who have experienced persistent elevations in porphobilinogen or porphyrins may detect early hepatocellular carcinoma. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Exacerbating factors that should be avoided include drugs such as: barbiturates, sulfonamide antibiotics, griseofulvin, rifampin, most anticonvulsants including phenytoin and carbamazepine, alcohol, ergot alkaloids, metoclopramide, and progestins. Although birth control pills should generally be avoided, low-dose hormonal preparations may be tolerated. Concomitant illnesses should be treated effectively using drugs that are considered safe whenever possible. Updated lists of safe and unsafe drugs are maintained at the websites of the American Porphyria Foundation and the European Porphyria Network. Evaluation of relatives at risk: At-risk family members can be offered molecular genetic testing for the family- specific PPOX pathogenic variant to identify those who are heterozygous (for the purpose of counseling regarding appropriate use of drugs and avoidance of known exacerbating factors). While biochemical testing, especially plasma fluorescence scanning and fecal porphyrin analysis, is also useful, it is less sensitive than molecular genetic testing. Pregnancy management: Exacerbations during pregnancy have been treated successfully with heme arginate or heme hydroxide (hematin); while neither preparation has been studied extensively during pregnancy, experience over many years suggests that treatment during pregnancy is unlikely to produce adverse fetal effects. Genetic counseling VP is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner with reduced penetrance. De novo pathogenic variants are rare. Each child of an individual with VP has a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant; while offspring who inherit the variant may or may not develop manifestations, most do not. Prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk for VP is possible if the pathogenic variant in an affected family member has been identified. Of note, the presence of a PPOX pathogenic variant does not predict whether or at what age an individual will become symptomatic. Porphyria 3"

Evaluation of relatives at risk: Molecular genetic testing for the familial POT1 pathogenic variant should be offered to first-degree relatives to identify those who would benefit from early surveillance and intervention. Although molecular genetic testing for POT1-TPD is generally not recommended for at-risk individuals younger than age 18 years, a history of early cancers in the family may warrant predictive testing prior to age 18. Genetic counseling POT1-TPD is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. To date, most individuals diagnosed with POT1- TPD have an affected parent; the proportion of POT1-TPD caused by a de novo pathogenic variant is unknown. Each child of an individual with POT1-TPD has a 50% chance of inheriting the POT1 pathogenic variant. It is important to note that clinical manifestations of POT1-TPD cannot be predicted in heterozygous family members because the full phenotypic spectrum and penetrance of POT1-TPD are unknown. The types of POT1- related tumors can vary among different members of the same family and current evidence is limited to disease- focused studies. Once the germline POT1 pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk for POT1-TPD and preimplantation genetic testing are possible."

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Potocki-Lupski syndrome (PTLS) is characterized by cognitive, behavioral, and medical manifestations. Cognitively, most individuals present with developmental delay, later meeting criteria for moderate intellectual disability. Behaviorally, issues with attention, hyperactivity, withdrawal, and anxiety may be seen. Some individuals meet criteria for autism spectrum disorder. Medically, hypotonia, oropharyngeal dysphagia leading to failure to thrive, congenital heart disease, hypoglycemia associated with growth hormone deficiency, and mildly dysmorphic facial features are observed. Medical manifestations typically lead to identification of PTLS in infancy; however, those with only behavioral and cognitive manifestations may be identified in later childhood. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of PTLS is established by detection of a heterozygous duplication at chromosome 17p11.2 that encompasses RAI1. A recurrent 3.7-Mb duplication accounts for approximately two thirds of 17p11.2 duplications; approximately one third are non-recurrent duplications that encompass RAI1 and vary in size from 0.41 Mb to 19.7 Mb. Management Treatment of manifestations: A multidisciplinary evaluation involving healthcare providers from multiple specialties varies by the age and presenting issues of each individual. Management of all manifestations of PTLS is per standard care. Surveillance: Routine monitoring for growth deceleration, short stature, failure to thrive; periodic developmental assessment by a developmental specialist; screen for behavior problems at every visit; consultation with a psychiatrist and/or psychologist if there are behavioral concerns; follow up of congenital heart disease as per cardiac consultant.

The majority of affected individuals have a de novo duplication; however, parent-to-child transmission has been reported. If the 17p11.2 duplication identified in the proband is not identified in either parent, the risk for future pregnancies could be slightly greater than that of the general population (though still <1%) because of the possibility of parental somatic and or germline mosaicism for the duplication. If one of the parents has the 17p11.2 duplication, the risk to each sib of inheriting the duplication is 50%. It is not possible to reliably predict the phenotype of individuals who inherit the duplication. Prenatal testing and preimplantation genetic testing using chromosomal microarray (CMA) to detect the 17q11.2 duplication found in the proband are possible."

Copyright 1993-2024, University of Washington, Seattle. GeneReviews is a registered trademark of the University of Washington, Seattle. All rights reserved. GeneReviews stromal tumors are most often diagnosed before age 40 years. Cystic nephroma generally presents in young children but has also been reported in adolescents. Additional clinical features that may be seen include macrocephaly, ocular abnormalities, structural anomalies of the kidney and collecting system, and dental anomalies (bulbous crowns). Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of DICER1 is established by identification of a heterozygous germline DICER1 pathogenic variant that is known or suspected to cause loss of function. Management Treatment of manifestations: Treatment for DICER1-associated malignant tumors is dependent on tumor type and stage. Most often treatment involves surgical resection with or without chemotherapy. The treatment of PPB may also include radiation, primarily to treat residual disease or recurrence. Thyroid nodules that have concerning features may require biopsy and/or surgical resection. Ovarian tumors require surgery and may also require chemotherapy. Ciliary body medulloepithelioma has been treated with resection or plaque brachytherapy. Surveillance: Chest radiograph shortly after birth is recommended for infants at risk for a germline DICER1 pathogenic variant. In individuals with confirmed DICER1, clinical examination and imaging-based surveillance for signs and symptoms of PPB, thyroid gland neoplasia, ovarian sex cord-stromal tumors, and other DICER1- associated tumors is recommended. Current imaging guidelines include chest radiograph every four to six months until age eight years, and every 12 months from age eight to 12 years. Chest CT at age three to six months with repeat chest CT at age 30 months to three years should be considered. Baseline chest radiograph or chest CT should be considered in those diagnosed after age 12 years. Thyroid ultrasound is recommended beginning at age eight years with subsequent ultrasounds every three to five years. Individuals with a history of chemotherapy exposure should begin thyroid ultrasound within three to five years of treatment. Thyroid function testing is recommended for individuals with symptoms of thyroid dysfunction. Pelvic ultrasounds for surveillance for gynecologic tumors in females are recommended every six to 12 months beginning at age eight years and extending until at least age 40 years. Screening for cystic nephroma and other renal tumors includes abdominal ultrasounds every six months until age eight years and then annually until age 12 years. Visual acuity measurement and dilated ophthalmology examination for ciliary body medulloepithelioma is recommended annually from age three years until at least age ten years. Annual physical examination should include assessment of extraocular movements, assessment of red reflex, neurologic examination, and thyroid palpation. Family education is the cornerstone of surveillance. Evaluation of relatives at risk: If a germline DICER1 pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, it is reasonable to offer molecular genetic testing to at-risk relatives of all ages to clarify their genetic status and to provide recommendations for age-appropriate surveillance and early intervention. Pregnancy management: In rare instances large lung cysts may cause respiratory distress in newborns, and thus a third-trimester ultrasound is recommended for pregnancies in which the fetus is at risk for a DICER1 pathogenic variant. If lung cysts are identified, consultation with specialists in high-risk obstetrics and fetal medicine is recommended. Genetic counseling DICER1 is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner with reduced penetrance. In individuals with PPB with a detectable germline DICER1 pathogenic variant, approximately 80% of the germline pathogenic variants were inherited from a parent and approximately 20% were de novo. Each child of an individual with a DICER1 germline pathogenic variant has a 50% chance of inheriting the variant. Given the reduced penetrance, many Tumor Predisposition 3 individuals with a germline DICER1 pathogenic variant remain clinically unaffected. Once a germline DICER1 pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing are possible."

The brain abnormalities are variable, with the most severe belonging to the holoprosencephaly spectrum and associated with moderate-to-profound intellectual disability, seizures, and feeding difficulties. In individuals without brain involvement, variable degrees of developmental delay and/or intellectual disability may be present, although normal intelligence has been seen in a minority of affected individuals. Eye (strabismus, microphthalmia/ anophthalmia) and skeletal abnormalities (kyphoscoliosis, joint contractures) can also be present in affected individuals of either sex.

Onset typically between ages three and six years begins with the involvement of the interphalangeal joints. Over time, involvement of large joints and the spine causes significant joint contractures, gait disturbance, and scoliosis and/or kyphosis, resulting in abnormal posture and significant morbidity. Despite the considerable arthropathy, pain is not a major presenting feature of this condition. Initially height is normal; however, short stature (<3rd centile) becomes evident in adolescence as the skeletal changes progress. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of PPD is established in a proband with characteristic radiographic features and/or identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in CCN6 (formerly WISP3) on molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Treatment is supportive. Pain due to secondary osteoarthritis may respond to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Severe joint pain due to advanced osteoarthritis is treated by joint arthroplasty. Large joint stiffness is managed by physical therapy, activity modification, and walking aids. Small joint arthropathy is managed by an occupational therapist who may advise adaptive devices, modification of activity, and/or vocational training. Scoliosis and mild kyphosis may be treated with bracing. Surgical treatment for angular deformities of the lower limbs as per orthopedic surgeon.

The order of appearance and/or predominance of these features and other associated neurologic and psychiatric findings vary. The three major phenotypes of genetic prion disease are genetic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (gCJD), fatal familial insomnia (FFI), and Gerstmann- Strussler-Scheinker (GSS) syndrome. Although these phenotypes display overlapping clinical and pathologic features, recognition of these phenotypes can be useful when providing affected individuals and their families with information about the expected clinical course. The age at onset typically ranges from 50 to 60 years. The disease course ranges from a few months in gCJD and FFI to a few (up to 4, and in rare cases up to 10) years in GSS syndrome. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of genetic prion disease is established in a proband with suggestive findings and a heterozygous PRNP pathogenic variant identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: No treatment of the underlying cause of genetic prion disease is available. Supportive care by a multidisciplinary team of specialists including neurologists, psychiatrists, physical therapists, occupational therapists, speech and language therapists, and social workers is recommended.

At birth, in contrast to individuals with congenital CPHD of other etiologies, neonates with PROP1-related CPHD lack perinatal signs of hypopituitarism. Mean birth weights and lengths are usually within the normal range and neonatal hypoglycemia and prolonged neonatal jaundice are not prevalent findings. Most affected individuals are ascertained because of short stature during childhood. Although TSH deficiency can present shortly after birth, TSH deficiency usually occurs with or after the onset of GH deficiency. Hypothyroidism is usually mild. FSH and LH deficiencies are typically identified at the age of onset of puberty. Affected individuals can have absent or delayed and incomplete secondary sexual development with infertility. Untreated males usually have a small penis and small testes. Some females experience menarche but subsequently require hormone replacement therapy. ACTH deficiency is less common and, when present, usually occurs in adolescence or adulthood. Neuroimaging of hypothalamic-pituitary region usually demonstrates a hypoplastic or normal anterior pituitary lobe and a normal posterior pituitary lobe.

Diagnosis/testing GeneReviews The diagnosis of PROP1-related CPHD is established in a proband with suggestive findings and biallelic pathogenic variants in PROP1 identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: GH deficiency is treated with injection of biosynthetic growth hormone. TSH deficiency is treated by thyroid hormone replacement in the form of oral L-thyroxine. In male infants with LH and FSH deficiency, micropenis is treated with a limited course of testosterone. Hormone replacement to induce secondary sex characteristics can be initiated in males at age 12 to 13 years with monthly injections of testosterone enanthate and in females at age 11 to 12 years with 17 beta-estradiol or estradiol valerate and later by cycling with progesterone. Fertility in both sexes is possible with administration of gonadotropins. ACTH deficiency is treated with hydrocortisone, with dose adjustments as needed for illness and/or surgeries. Surveillance: IGF1, total T4, free T4, estradiol (in females) or testosterone (in males), and cortisol levels every three to four months; measure PrL at diagnosis. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Thyroid hormone replacement in those with untreated adrenal insufficiency; for individuals with GH deficiency, the lowest safe dose of hydrocortisone is used to avoid interfering with the growth response to growth hormone therapy.

    "_id": "propionic-a",
    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics The spectrum of propionic acidemia (PA) ranges from neonatal onset to late-diagnosed disease. Neonatal-onset PA, the most common form, is characterized by a healthy newborn with poor feeding and decreased arousal in the first few days of life, followed by progressive encephalopathy of unexplained origin. Without prompt diagnosis (often through newborn screening) and management, this is followed by progressive encephalopathy manifesting as lethargy, seizures, or coma that can result in death. It is frequently accompanied by metabolic acidosis with anion gap, lactic acidosis, ketonuria, hypoglycemia, hyperammonemia, and cytopenias. Individuals with late-diagnosed PA may remain asymptomatic and suffer a metabolic crisis under catabolic stress (e.g., illness, surgery, fasting) or may experience a more insidious onset with the development of multiorgan complications including vomiting, protein intolerance, failure to thrive, hypotonia, developmental delays or regression, movement disorders, or cardiomyopathy. Isolated cardiomyopathy can be observed on rare occasions in the absence of clinical metabolic decompensation or neurocognitive deficits. Manifestations of neonatal-onset and late-diagnosed PA over time can include growth impairment, intellectual disability, seizures, basal ganglia lesions, pancreatitis, cardiomyopathy, and chronic kidney disease. Other rarely reported complications include optic atrophy, sensorineural hearing loss, and premature ovarian insufficiency. Diagnosis/testing PA is caused by deficiency of propionyl-coenzyme A carboxylase (PCC), the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of propionyl-CoA to methylmalonyl-CoA. Newborns with PA tested by expanded newborn screening (NBS) have elevated C3 (propionylcarnitine). Testing of urine organic acids in persons who are symptomatic or those detected by NBS reveals elevated 3-hydroxypropionate and the presence of methylcitrate, tiglylglycine, propionylglycine, and lactic acid. Testing of plasma amino acids generally reveals elevated glycine.

GeneReviews Confirmation of the diagnosis relies on detection of biallelic pathogenic variants in PCCA or PCCB by molecular genetic testing, or detection of deficient PCC enzymatic activity. In individuals with equivocal molecular genetic test results, a combination of enzymatic and molecular diagnostics may be necessary. Management Treatment of manifestations: The treatment of individuals with acutely decompensated PA is a medical emergency: treat precipitating factors such as infection, dehydration, vomiting; reverse catabolism by providing intravenous glucose and lipids; manage protein intake to reduce propiogenic precursors; remove toxic compounds using intravenous carnitine, and when necessary nitrogen scavenger medications and/or extracorporeal detoxification; transfer to a center with biochemical genetics expertise and the ability to support urgent hemodialysis, especially if hyperammonemia is present. Prevention of primary manifestations: Individualized dietary management should be directed by an experienced physician and metabolic dietician to control the intake of propiogenic substrates and to guide increased caloric intake during illness to prevent catabolism, typically by using specialized medical food. Gastrostomy tube placement is an effective strategy to facilitate the administration of medications and nutrition during acute decompensations and to improve adherence in chronic management of PA. Medications may include L-carnitine supplementation to enhance excretion of propionic acid and oral metronidazole to reduce propionate production by gut bacteria. Orthotopic liver transplantation may be indicated in those with frequent metabolic decompensations, uncontrollable hyperammonemia, and/or poor growth. Prevention of secondary complications: Consistent evaluation of the protein prescription, depending on age, sex, level of physical activity, severity of disorder, and presence of other factors such as intercurrent illness, surgery, and growth spurts to avoid insufficient or excessive protein intake is necessary. Excessive protein restriction or overreliance on medical foods can result in deficiency of essential amino acids and impaired growth, as well as catabolism-induced metabolic decompensation. Surveillance: Monitor affected individuals with a catabolic stressor (fasting, fever, illness, injury, and surgery) closely to prevent and/or detect and manage metabolic decompensations early. Regularly assess: (1) growth, nutritional status, feeding ability, and psychomotor development; (2) vision and hearing; (3) cardiac function for signs of cardiomyopathy and prolonged QT interval; (4) metabolic status by monitoring routine chemistries, plasma ammonia, plasma amino acids, and plasma carnitine levels; (5) complete blood count; and (6) kidney function. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Avoid prolonged fasting, catabolic stressors, and excessive protein intake. Lactated Ringer's solution is not recommended in individuals with organic acidemias. In individuals with QT abnormalities, avoid medications that can prolong the QT interval. Neuroleptic antiemetics (e.g., promethazine) can mask symptoms of progressive encephalopathy and are best avoided. Evaluation of relatives at risk: Testing of at-risk sibs of an affected individual is warranted to allow for early diagnosis and treatment. Genetic counseling PA is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. If both parents are known to be heterozygous for a PCCA or PCCB pathogenic variant, each sib of an affected individual has at conception a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of inheriting neither of the familial pathogenic variants. Once the PCCA or PCCB pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member, molecular genetic carrier testing of at-risk relatives and prenatal/preimplantation genetic testing are possible.

In most individuals PS has modest or no manifestations at birth, develops and progresses rapidly beginning in the toddler period, and relentlessly progresses through childhood, causing severe overgrowth and disfigurement. It is associated with a range of tumors, pulmonary complications, and a striking predisposition to deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of PS is established in a proband with all three general criteria (mosaic distribution of lesions, sporadic occurrence, progressive course) and a clinical score based on positive and negative criteria of at least ten points in an individual with a mosaic AKT1 pathogenic variant or at least 15 points in an individual without a mosaic AKT1 pathogenic variant identified by molecular genetic testing. The diagnosis of AKT1-related overgrowth spectrum is established in an individual with a mosaic AKT1 pathogenic variant and a clinical score of 2-9. Management Treatment of manifestations: Management of overgrowth including orthopedic procedures to delay or halt linear bone growth; rehabilitation medicine care including physical and occupational therapy; correction of skeletal deformities such as scoliosis; dermatologic management of the skin manifestations, especially the cerebriform connective tissue nevi with pedorthic intervention as needed; surgery as needed for lipomatous overgrowth; evaluation and treatment of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism; treatment of tumors per surgeon and/or oncologist; treatment of bullous pulmonary disease per pulmonologist; developmental intervention and/or special education for developmental delays; psychosocial counseling is warranted in most individuals.

Age at onset and phenotypes range from neonatal/infantile (self-limited [familial] infantile epilepsy), to childhood (childhood absence epilepsy), to adolescence to adulthood (paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia [PKD] or migraine). As individuals with PRRT2-related disorder age, they may exhibit one of more of these core phenotypes in various combinations, either concurrently or sequentially.

Manifestations of acute pancreatitis can range from vague abdominal pain lasting one to three days to severe abdominal pain lasting days to weeks and requiring hospitalization. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of PRSS1-related hereditary pancreatitis is established in a proband with episodes of AP, RAP, and/or CP and a heterozygous pathogenic gain-of-function variant in PRSS1 identified by molecular genetic testing. Note that, because of incomplete penetrance, identification of a disease-associated PRSS1 variant in an asymptomatic individual is not sufficient for a clinical diagnosis. High-penetrance PRSS1 pathogenic variants include p.Asn29Ile and p.Arg122His, and lower-penetrance pathogenic variants include p.Arg16Val and p.Arg122Cys. Other pathogenic PRSS1 variants are recognized; these latter variants typically require additional risk factors to cause disease and do not cause autosomal dominant hereditary pancreatitis. Management Treatment of manifestations: AP episodes are treated with rapid assessment of severity and fluid resuscitation as needed. Individuals with HP should be counseled not to delay in being assessed for AP since hypovolemia and shock leads to serious organ dysfunction and failure.

Often the presenting feature is a waddling gait, recognized at the onset of walking. Typically, the growth rate falls below the standard growth curve by approximately age two years, leading to a moderately severe form of disproportionate short-limb short stature. Joint pain during childhood, particularly in the large joints of the lower extremities, is common. Degenerative joint disease is progressive; approximately 50% of individuals with COMP-PSACH eventually require hip replacement surgery. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of COMP-PSACH can be made on the basis of clinical findings and radiographic features. Identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in COMP on molecular genetic testing establishes the diagnosis if clinical features are inconclusive. Management Treatment of manifestations: Analgesics for joint pain; encourage physical activities that do not cause excessive wear and/or damage to the joints; osteotomy for lower limb malalignment; rarely, surgery for scoliosis; C1-C2 fixation for symptoms and radiographic evidence of cervical spine instability; attention to and social support for psychosocial issues related to short stature for affected individuals and their families.

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Prothrombin thrombophilia is characterized by venous thromboembolism (VTE) manifest most commonly in adults as deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) in the legs or pulmonary embolism. The clinical expression of prothrombin thrombophilia is variable; many individuals heterozygous or homozygous for the 20210G>A F2 variant never develop thrombosis, and while most heterozygotes who develop thrombotic complications remain asymptomatic until adulthood, some have recurrent thromboembolism before age 30 years. The relative risk for DVT in adults heterozygous for the 20210G>A variant is two- to fivefold increased; in children, the relative risk for thrombosis is three- to fourfold increased. Heterozygosity for 20210G>A has at most a modest effect on recurrence risk after a first episode. Although prothrombin thrombophilia may increase the risk for pregnancy loss, its association with preeclampsia and other complications of pregnancy such as intrauterine growth restriction and placental abruption remains controversial. Factors that predispose to thrombosis in prothrombin thrombophilia include: the number of 20210G>A alleles; presence of coexisting genetic abnormalities including factor V Leiden; and acquired thrombophilic disorders (e.g., antiphospholipid antibodies). Circumstantial risk factors for thrombosis include pregnancy and oral contraceptive use. Some evidence suggests that the risk for VTE in 20210G>A heterozygotes increases after air travel. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of prothrombin thrombophilia is established in a proband by identification of a heterozygous or homozygous 20210G>A variant (also known as c.*97G>A) in F2, the gene encoding prothrombin. Management Treatment of manifestations: Management depends on the clinical circumstances. The first acute thrombosis is treated according to standard guidelines. The duration of anticoagulation therapy is determined by assessment of the risks for VTE recurrence and anticoagulant-related bleeding. 20210G>A heterozygosity alone is not an indication for long-term anticoagulation in the absence of other risk factors.

GeneReviews Surveillance: Individuals receiving long-term anticoagulation require periodic reevaluation to confirm that the benefits of anticoagulation continue to outweigh the risk of bleeding. 20210G>A heterozygotes who do not require long-term anticoagulation may benefit from evaluation prior to exposure to circumstantial risk factors such as surgery or pregnancy. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Women heterozygous for 20210G>A with a history of VTE and women homozygous for 20210G>A with or without prior VTE should avoid estrogen-containing contraception and hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Pregnancy management: No consensus exists on the optimal management of prothrombin thrombophilia during pregnancy; guidelines for treatment of VTE are derived from studies in non-pregnant individuals. Genetic counseling Prothrombin thrombophilia is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner: heterozygosity for the 20210G>A variant results in an increased risk for thrombosis; homozygosity for this variant confers a higher risk for thrombosis than heterozygosity. Occasionally (because of the relatively high frequency of the 20210G>A variant in the general population) one parent is homozygous for the 20210G>A variant or both parents are heterozygous for the 20210G>A variant. The genetic status of both parents and/or the reproductive partner of an affected individual needs to be evaluated before information regarding potential risks to sibs or offspring can be provided. If one parent of a heterozygous proband is heterozygous for the 20210G>A variant, the sibs of the proband are at 50% risk of being heterozygous; if one parent is homozygous, the sibs of the proband will be heterozygous.

Individuals most commonly present with angioid streaks of the retina found on routine eye examination or associated with retinal hemorrhage and/or characteristic papules in the skin. The most frequent cause of morbidity and disability in PXE is reduced vision due to complications of subretinal neovascularizations and macular atrophy.

To date Warburg micro syndrome comprises >96% of reported individuals with genetically defined RAB18 deficiency. The hallmark ophthalmologic findings are bilateral congenital cataracts, usually accompanied by microphthalmia, microcornea (diameter <10), and small atonic pupils. Poor vision despite early cataract surgery likely results from progressive optic atrophy and cortical visual impairment. Individuals with Warburg micro syndrome have severe to profound intellectual disability (ID); those with Martsolf syndrome have mild to moderate ID. Some individuals with RAB18 deficiency also have epilepsy. In Warburg micro syndrome, a progressive ascending spastic paraplegia typically begins with spastic diplegia and contractures during the first year, followed by upper-limb involvement leading to spastic quadriplegia after about age five years, often eventually causing breathing difficulties. In Martsolf syndrome infantile hypotonia is followed primarily by slowly progressive lower-limb spasticity. Hypogonadism when present manifests in both syndromes, in males as micropenis and/or cryptorchidism and in females as hypoplastic labia minora, clitoral hypoplasia, and small introitus.

After their initial appearance, symptoms often stabilize with little improvement; occasionally second episodes occur with abrupt worsening of symptoms. Rarely, affected individuals have reported a more gradual onset of symptoms over weeks to months. Anxiety, depression, and seizures have been reported. Age of onset ranges from four to 55 years, although a childhood variation of RDP with onset between ages nine and 14 months has been reported. AHC is a complex neurodevelopmental syndrome most frequently manifesting in infancy or early childhood with paroxysmal episodic neurologic dysfunction including alternating hemiparesis or dystonia, quadriparesis, seizure-like episodes, and oculomotor abnormalities. Episodes can last for minutes, hours, days, or even weeks. Remission of symptoms occurs with sleep and immediately after awakening. Over time, persistent neurologic deficits including oculomotor apraxia, ataxia, choreoathetosis, dystonia, parkinsonism, and cognitive and behavioral dysfunction develop in the Author Affiliations: 1 Professor and Chair, Department of Neurology Wake Forest School of Medicine Winston-Salem, North Carolina; Email: abrashea@wakehealth.edu. 2 Associate Professor of Cellular and Molecular Physiology, Department of Surgery Massachusetts General Hospital Boston, Massachusetts; Email: sweadner@helix.mgh.harvard.edu. 3 Project Manager, Department of Neurology Wake Forest University School of Medicine Winston-Salem, North Carolina; Email: jarcook@wakehealth.edu. 4 Director, Neurogenetics Unit Center for Genomic Medicine Department of Neurology Massachusetts General Hospital Boston, Massachusetts; Email: kswoboda@mgh.harvard.edu. 5 Associate Neuroscientist, Department of Neurology Massachusetts General Hospital Boston, Massachusetts; Email: lozelius@partners.org.

GeneReviews majority of those affected; more than 50% develop epilepsy in addition to their episodic movement disorder phenotype. CAPOS (cerebellar ataxia, areflexia, pes cavus, optic atrophy, and sensorineural hearing loss) syndrome is characterized by episodes of ataxic encephalopathy and/or weakness during and after a febrile illness. Onset is between ages six months and four years. Some acute symptoms resolve; progression of sensory losses and severity vary. Diagnosis/testing Diagnosis of an ATP1A3-related neurologic disorder is established in an individual with the clinical features of RDP, AHC, or CAPOS syndrome and/or by the identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in ATP1A3. Management Treatment of manifestations: Standard treatment of visual disturbance, hearing loss, seizure disorders, cardiac arrhythmia, and cardiomyopathy. Consideration of CPAP or BiPAP for those with sleep apnea. Those with severe dysphagia may require a gastrostomy tube. Physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy for motor dysfunction, ataxia, and dysarthria. Acute spasms may respond to chloral hydrate or other medication that induces sleep. Dystonia can be treated with benzodiazepines, dopamine agonists, or levo-dopa. Psychotherapy and standard pharmacotherapy for those with mood disorder or psychosis. Early referral for developmental support / special education. Prevention of primary manifestations: Prophylaxis for AHC episodes may include flunarizine, topiramate, a ketogenic diet, and sleep. A trial of high-dose benzodiazepines may be considered in individuals with RDP and AHC. Triggers that lead to acute attacks should be avoided. Prevention of secondary complications: When dystonia is present, physical therapy to prevent contractures in the hands and feet. Surveillance. Affected individuals should be monitored for the development of dysphagia (RDP and CAPOS syndrome), seizures (RDP and AHC), and psychiatric symptoms (RDP). Agents/circumstances to avoid: RDP. Triggers including alcohol, fever, psychological stress (e.g., childbirth), excessive exercise. AHC. Triggers including psychological stress / excitement; environmental stressors (e.g., bright light, excessive heat or cold, excessive sound, crowds); water exposure (e.g., bathing, swimming); certain foods or odors (e.g., chocolate, food dyes); missed meals; excessive or atypically strenuous exercise; illness; irregular sleep (missing a nap, delayed bedtime). CAPOS syndrome. Febrile illness, pregnancy. Pregnancy management: Affected pregnant women should be monitored for the development of symptoms of RDP. The number of pregnant women with RDP is small, but several reports of childbirth as a trigger have been noted. Exposure to anti-seizure medication may increase the risk to the fetus of adverse outcome; that risk, however, is often less than the risk to the fetus associated with exposure to an untreated maternal seizure disorder. Discussion of the risks and benefits of using a given anti-seizure medication during pregnancy should ideally take place before conception. Genetic counseling ATP1A3-related neurologic disorders are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. ATP1A3 pathogenic variants may be inherited or occur de novo. In contrast to initial reports a familial history is not required for a diagnosis of RDP. In AHC, pathogenic variants are more commonly de novo than inherited; in both RDP and Neurologic Disorders 3 CAPOS syndrome both inherited and de novo pathogenic variants have been observed. Each child of an individual with an ATP1A3-related neurologic disorder has a 50% chance of inheriting the ATP1A3 pathogenic variant. Prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk is possible if the ATP1A3 pathogenic variant in the family is known. The variability of presentation within a family with a known ATP1A3 pathogenic variant further complicates genetic counseling. Lifelong asymptomatic individuals who harbor a heterozygous ATP1A3 pathogenic variant have been reported in families with RDP."

    "_id": "retinoblastoma",
    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Retinoblastoma is a malignant tumor of the developing retina that occurs in children, usually before age five years. Retinoblastoma may be unifocal or multifocal. About 60% of affected individuals have unilateral retinoblastoma with a mean age of diagnosis of 24 months; about 40% have bilateral retinoblastoma with a mean age of diagnosis of 15 months. Heritable retinoblastoma is associated with susceptibility for retinoblastoma as well as non-ocular tumors. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of retinoblastoma is usually established by examination of the fundus of the eye using indirect ophthalmoscopy. Imaging studies can be used to support the diagnosis and stage the tumor. Almost all retinoblastomas develop following biallelic inactivation of RB1 in a cone cell precursor in the developing retina. The diagnosis of heritable retinoblastoma is established in a proband with retinoblastoma or retinoma (benign potential precursor to retinoblastoma) and a family history of retinoblastoma or a heterozygous germline pathogenic variant in RB1 identified by molecular genetic testing. Epigenetic hypermethylation of the RB1 promotor also results in inactivation of RB1 but cannot be transmitted via the germline. Amplification of MYCN in a developing retinal cone cell can also result in retinoblastoma that is not thought to be heritable. The following staging has been recommended for individuals with retinoblastoma and/or risk of heritable retinoblastoma to describe the genetic risk of a germline pathogenic variant in RB1: HX.

Individual with bilateral retinoblastoma, trilateral retinoblastoma (retinoblastoma with intracranial central nervous system midline embryonic tumor), retinoblastoma and a family history of retinoblastoma, or identification of a germline RB1 pathogenic variant Management Treatment of manifestations: Early diagnosis and treatment of retinoblastoma can reduce morbidity and increase longevity; care is best provided by multidisciplinary teams of specialists including ophthalmology, pediatric oncology, pathology, and radiation oncology. Treatment options depend on tumor stage, number of tumor foci (unifocal, unilateral multifocal, or bilateral), localization and size of the tumor(s) within the eye(s), presence of vitreous seeding, potential for useful vision, extent and kind of extraocular extension, and resources available. Treatment options include enucleation; cryotherapy; laser; systemic or local ocular chemotherapy, including intra-arterial chemotherapy, combined with or followed by laser or cryotherapy; radiation therapy using episcleral plaques; and, as a last resort, external beam radiotherapy. Standard treatments for non-ocular neoplasms. Surveillance: Individuals with an RB1 germline pathogenic variant (H1) should have eye examinations (under anesthesia in young children) every three to four weeks until age six months, every two months until age three years, every three to six months until age seven years, annually until age ten years, and then every two years in order to identify a retinoblastoma as early as possible. In individuals with unilateral retinoblastoma without an identified heterozygous germline RB1 pathogenic variant (H0*), clinical eye examination and eye ultrasound every three to six months until age seven years, then every two years. In individuals with retinomas, retinal examinations and imaging every one to two years. To detect non-ocular tumors, prompt clinical investigation of any signs and/or symptoms of malignant neoplasms. Agents/circumstances to avoid: If possible, radiation (including x-rays, CT scans, and external beam radiation) and DNA damaging agents (tobacco, UV light) should be avoided in individuals with heritable retinoblastoma (H1) to minimize the lifetime risk of developing subsequent malignant neoplasms. It is plausible that cancer risks in these individuals may also be reduced by limiting exposure to chemotherapy. Evaluation of relatives at risk: Molecular genetic testing if the pathogenic variant in the family is known (which can reduce the need for costly screening procedures in those family members who have not inherited the pathogenic variant [i.e., H0]) or eye examinations by an ophthalmologist experienced in the treatment of retinoblastoma if the pathogenic variant is not known for early identification of asymptomatic at-risk children. Genetic counseling Heritable retinoblastoma is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. The majority of individuals with heritable retinoblastoma represent simplex cases (i.e., the only person in the family known to be affected). Some individuals diagnosed with heritable retinoblastoma inherited an RB1 pathogenic variant from an affected parent. Each child of an individual with heritable retinoblastoma (H1) has a 50% chance of inheriting the RB1 pathogenic variant. If the RB1 pathogenic variants that have been detected in tumor tissue are not detected in DNA from leukocytes of the proband, there is an estimated 1.2% chance that the proband has germline mosaicism for one of the pathogenic variants identified in the tumor tissue and the offspring of the proband are at a 0.6% risk of inheriting a germline pathogenic variant. If one of the pathogenic variants identified in the proband's tumor is found to be mosaic in DNA from leukocytes of the proband, the level of germline involvement is uncertain. Predictive DNA testing in offspring is possible if the cancer-predisposing germline RB1 variant has been identified in the proband. If molecular genetic testing is not available or is uninformative in the proband, empiric risks to offspring based on tumor presentation and family history can be used. If the germline RB1 pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing are possible."

Females: Classic Rett syndrome, a progressive neurodevelopmental disorder primarily affecting girls, is characterized by apparently normal psychomotor development during the first six to 18 months of life, followed by a short period of developmental stagnation, then rapid regression in language and motor skills, followed by long-term stability. During the phase of rapid regression, repetitive, stereotypic hand movements replace purposeful hand use. Additional findings include fits of screaming and inconsolable crying, autistic features, panic-like attacks, bruxism, episodic apnea and/or hyperpnea, gait ataxia and apraxia, tremors, seizures, and acquired microcephaly. Males: Severe neonatal-onset encephalopathy, the most common phenotype in affected males, is characterized by a relentless clinical course that follows a metabolic-degenerative type of pattern, abnormal tone, involuntary movements, severe seizures, and breathing abnormalities. Death often occurs before age two years. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of a MECP2 disorder is established by molecular genetic testing in a female proband with suggestive findings and a heterozygous MECP2 pathogenic variant, and in a male proband with suggestive findings and a hemizygous MECP2 pathogenic variant.

Surveillance: Periodic evaluation by the multidisciplinary team; regular assessment of QTc for evidence of prolongation; regular assessment for scoliosis. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Drugs known to prolong the QT interval. Genetic counseling MECP2 disorders are inherited in an X-linked manner. More than 99% are simplex cases (i.e., a single occurrence in a family), resulting from a de novo pathogenic variant or possibly from inheritance of the pathogenic variant from a parent who has germline mosaicism. Rarely, a MECP2 variant may be inherited from a heterozygous mother in whom favorable skewing of X-chromosome inactivation results in minimal to no clinical findings. When the mother is a known heterozygote, the risk to her offspring of inheriting the MECP2 variant is 50%. When the pathogenic MECP2 variant has been identified in the family, heterozygote testing for at-risk female relatives, prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk, and preimplantation genetic testing are possible. Because of the possibility of parental germline mosaicism, it is appropriate to offer prenatal diagnosis to couples who have had a child with a MECP2 disorder regardless of whether the MECP2 pathogenic variant has been detected in a parent."

Management Treatment of manifestations: The goals of treatment are to maximize function and reduce complications. Depending on the clinical manifestations, each affected individual should be managed by a multidisciplinary team of relevant specialists such as neurologists, occupational therapists, physical therapists, physiatrists, and (depending on individual needs) speech therapists, respiratory therapists, nutritionists, and gastroenterologists. Surveillance: Routine follow up by multidisciplinary specialists to assess: progression of neurologic findings; mobility, self-help skills; need for alternative communication methods; and aspiration risk and feeding methods.

    "chunk_text": "Clinical description Riboflavin transporter deficiency (RTD), comprising RTD2 and RTD3 (caused by biallelic pathogenic variants in SLC52A2 and SLC52A3, respectively) is a rare neurologic condition characterized by progressive peripheral and cranial neuronopathy that causes muscle weakness (and consequent respiratory compromise), vision loss, deafness, and sensory ataxia. Onset is usually in infancy or in childhood; however, on occasion individuals with genetically confirmed RTD present as adults and even as late as the fifth decade. When untreated, most infants with riboflavin transporter deficiency rapidly become ventilator dependent and die in the first decade of life. In the majority of affected individuals, the initial finding is sensorineural hearing loss, which is usually progressive and severe. The time between the onset of hearing loss and the development of other manifestations varies but is usually one to two years. In some individuals an intercurrent event, usually an injury or infection, appears to precipitate the initial manifestations or worsen existing findings. One case report (which requires additional confirmation) suggests that biallelic expression of pathogenic variants in SLC52A1 (i.e., RTD1) is associated with infantile-onset of riboflavin-responsive seizures associated with hyperammonemia. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of RTD2 and RTD3 is established in an individual with suggestive findings and biallelic pathogenic variants in either SLC52A2 or SLC52A3, respectively, identified on molecular genetic testing.

Copyright 1993-2024, University of Washington, Seattle. GeneReviews is a registered trademark of the University of Washington, Seattle. All rights reserved. Management GeneReviews Treatment of manifestations: High-dose oral supplementation of riboflavin (vitamin B2) between 10 mg and 50 mg/kg/day improves symptoms and signs on clinical examination, improves objective testing (vital capacity, brain stem evoked potentials, nerve conduction studies), and normalizes acylcarnitine levels. Liquid riboflavin is available but is often difficult to obtain; therefore, riboflavin capsules are often opened and mixed with food such as yogurt. The amount of riboflavin supplementation varies depending on the severity of the disease and response of the individual to the treatment. When riboflavin supplementation is given earlier in the disease course, the response can be very good; if given later in the disease course, the response is less, likely reflecting the effect of existing neuronal damage. Because oral riboflavin supplementation is effective (and possibly lifesaving), it should begin as soon as a riboflavin transporter deficiency is suspected and continued lifelong unless molecular genetic testing fails to identify biallelic pathogenic variants in either SLC52A2 or SLC52A3. Supportive care includes respiratory support; physiotherapy to avoid contractures; occupational therapy to support activities of daily living; orthotics for limb and trunk bracing; speech and language therapy to avoid choking and respiratory problems; wheelchair as needed; low vision aids as needed; routine management of scoliosis to avoid long-term respiratory problems; and routine management of depression. Surveillance: At three months and six months after initiation of riboflavin supplementation, routine follow-up physical and neurologic examinations, measurement of blood riboflavin/FAD/FMN, and analysis of blood acylcarnitine profile. Thereafter, follow up is usually biannually in older individuals and more frequently in younger children. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Dietary restriction of riboflavin and strenuous physical activity. Evaluation of relatives at risk: When the SLC52A2 or SLC52A3 pathogenic variants in the family are known, it is appropriate to perform molecular genetic testing on the older and younger sibs of an affected individual to identify as early as possible those who are affected and would benefit from early treatment with riboflavin supplementation and monitoring for potential complications of the disorder. Pregnancy management: A diet rich in ribolflavin is recommended for women who have RTD or are heterozygous for a pathogenic variant in either SLC52A2 or SLC52A3. If necessary, riboflavin supplements should be taken before and during pregnancy and when breast feeding to avoid inducing riboflavin deficiency in the baby. Genetic counseling RTD caused by biallelic pathogenic variants in either SLC52A2 (RTD2) or SLC52A3 (RTD3) is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. If both parents are known to be heterozygous for an RTD-causing pathogenic variant, each sib of an affected individual has at conception a 25% chance of inheriting biallelic pathogenic variants and being affected, a 50% chance of inheriting one pathogenic variant and being heterozygous, and a 25% chance of inheriting neither of the familial RTD-causing pathogenic variants. Carrier testing for at-risk relatives and prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk are possible if both RTD-causing pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member."

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics The phenotypic spectrum of X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH) ranges from isolated hypophosphatemia to severe lower extremity bowing and/or craniosynostosis, usually involving the sagittal suture with consequent scaphocephaly. XLH typically manifests in the first two years of life with lower extremity bowing due to the onset of weight-bearing; however, it sometimes does not manifest until adulthood, as previously unevaluated short stature. Adults may present with calcification of the tendons, ligaments, and joint capsules, joint pain, fatigue, insufficiency fractures, and impaired mobility. Persons with XLH are prone to spontaneous dental abscesses; sensorineural hearing loss has also been reported. Rarely, individuals with XLH can suffer from spinal stenosis, Chiari I malformation, syringomyelia, and/or raised intracranial pressure. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis is established in a proband with characteristic clinical, biochemical, and radiographic findings by identification of a hemizygous PHEX pathogenic variant in a male proband or a heterozygous PHEX pathogenic variant in a female proband on molecular genetic testing. Management Targeted therapy: Burosumab, a monoclonal antibody against FGF23. If burosumab is unavailable, conventional treatment with oral phosphate and active vitamin D analogues (alfacalcidol or calcitriol) to improve pain, promote fracture healing, and, in growing children, to correct and/or prevent bone deformation.

GeneReviews Supportive care: Craniosynostosis treatment by craniofacial specialists; persistent lower extremity bowing and/or torsion resulting in misalignment of the lower extremity may require surgery; total hip or knee arthroplasty as needed for degenerative joint disease; rehabilitation, physiotherapy, and analgesics for musculoskeletal pain; surgical treatment for those with tertiary hyperparathyroidism; good oral hygiene with flossing, regular dental care, fluoride treatments, and sealants to prevent dental abscesses; standard treatment of sensorineural hearing loss; education and psychosocial support; standard treatment of cardiovascular comorbidities; consider physical medicine and rehabilitation, analgesics as needed, and evaluation for sleep apnea in those with fatigue. Surveillance: For individuals on burosumab therapy, regular monitoring of serum concentrations of phosphate, calcium, creatinine, alkaline phosphatase, and intact parathyroid hormone. For those on conventional treatment with active vitamin D and phosphate supplementation, additional testing includes urinary calcium and creatinine to assess for hypercalciuria; periodic renal ultrasound examination to assess for nephrocalcinosis. For all individuals, assess growth and lower limb alignment at each visit throughout childhood; craniofacial examination at each visit throughout infancy; clinical assessment of joint mobility and pain at each visit; imaging of painful areas to assess for calcifications, pseudofractures, and/or insufficiency fractures; dental evaluation every six months; hearing evaluation and evaluation for Chiari I malformation performed based on clinical suspicion; assess psychosocial impact, fatigue, sleep issues, and quality of life at each visit; monitor weight, blood pressure, and cardiovascular risk factors at each visit. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Treatment with phosphate without 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, because of the increased risk for secondary hyperparathyroidism. Although 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D has been used as a single agent, this may increase the risk for hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, and nephrocalcinosis. Bisphosphonates or osteoporosis medications may cause deterioration of osteomalacia in some individuals. Evaluation of relatives at risk: Molecular genetic testing (if the PHEX pathogenic variant has been identified in the family) or biochemical testing of first-degree relatives at risk to ensure early treatment for optimal outcome. Pregnancy management: There is generally no need for additional fetal monitoring or cesarean sections in pregnant women with XLH. Burosumab is not recommended during pregnancy. The benefit of phosphate and active vitamin D analogs in pregnant women who have XLH remains debated. Most women with XLH who are on oral phosphate and active vitamin D therapy at the time of conception are continued on treatment throughout the pregnancy with vigilant monitoring of urinary calcium-to-creatinine ratios to detect hypercalciuria early in order to modify treatment accordingly. Genetic counseling XLH is inherited in an X-linked manner; hemizygous males and heterozygous females are similarly affected. Affected males transmit the PHEX pathogenic variant to all of their daughters (who will be heterozygotes and will be affected) and none of their sons. Affected females have a 50% chance of transmitting the pathogenic variant to each child: male and female offspring who inherit the pathogenic variant will be affected. The severity of manifestations can differ among family members who inherit a PHEX pathogenic variant; intrafamilial clinical variability does not correlate with the sex of the affected family member. If the PHEX pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing for XLH are possible."

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Silver-Russell Syndrome (SRS) is typically characterized by gestational growth restriction resulting in affected individuals being born small for gestational age, with relative macrocephaly at birth (head circumference 1.5 standard deviations [SD] above birth weight and/or length), prominent forehead with frontal bossing, and frequently body asymmetry. This is typically followed by postnatal growth failure, and in some cases progressive limb length discrepancy and feeding difficulties. Additional clinical features include triangular facies, fifth finger clinodactyly, and micrognathia with narrow chin. Except for the limb length asymmetry, growth failure is proportionate and head growth typically normal. The average adult height in untreated individuals is ~3.11.4 SD below the mean. The Netchine-Harbison Clinical Scoring System (NH-CSS) is a sensitive diagnostic scoring system. Clinical diagnosis can be established in an individual who meets at least four of the NH-CSS clinical criteria prominent forehead/frontal bossing and relative macrocephaly at birth plus two additional findings and in whom other disorders have been ruled out. Diagnosis/testing SRS is a genetically heterogeneous condition. Genetic testing confirms clinical diagnosis in approximately 60% of affected individuals. Hypomethylation of the imprinting control region 1 (ICR1) at 11p15.5 causes SRS in 35%-67% of individuals, and maternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 7 (upd(7)mat) causes SRS in 7%-10% of individuals. There are a small number of individuals with SRS who have duplications, deletions, or translocations involving the imprinting centers at 11p15.5 or duplications, deletions, or translocations involving chromosome 7. Rarely, affected individuals with pathogenic variants in CDKN1C, IGF2, PLAG1, and HMGA2 have been described. However, approximately 30%-40% of individuals who meet NH-CSS clinical criteria for SRS have negative molecular and/or cytogenetic testing.

Management GeneReviews Treatment of manifestations: Multidisciplinary follow up and early specific intervention are necessary for optimal management of affected individuals, including early referral to an endocrinologist. Treatment may include growth hormone therapy. Hypoglycemia should be prevented or aggressively managed. Strategies for feeding issues include nutritional and caloric supplementation, medication for gastroesophageal reflux, therapy for oral motor problems and oral aversion, cyproheptadine for appetite stimulation, and enteral tube feeding as needed. Lower limb length discrepancy exceeding 2 cm requires intervention. In the majority of affected older children, distraction osteogenesis is recommended. Severe micrognathia or cleft palate should be managed by a multidisciplinary craniofacial team. Males with cryptorchidism or hypospadias should be referred to a urologist. Males with micropenis and females with internal genitourinary anomalies benefit from a referral to a multidisciplinary disorders of sex development (DSD) center. Physical, occupational, speech, and language therapy with an individualized education plan are used to treat developmental delays. Psychological counseling can be used as needed to address psychosocial and body image issues. Surveillance: Monitoring of growth velocity, blood glucose concentration, and urine ketones for hypoglycemia in infants and as needed in older children; evaluation of nutritional status and oral intake at each visit as well as managing tube feedings if needed; limb length assessment at each well child visit in early childhood for evidence of asymmetric growth; evaluation for scoliosis, signs of precocious puberty, genitourinary issues, dental crowding and malocclusion, and speech-language development at each visit. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Prolonged fasting in infants and young children because of the risk for hypoglycemia; elective surgery whenever possible due to risk of hypoglycemia, hypothermia, difficult healing, and difficult intubation. Genetic counseling Risk to family members: In most families, a proband with SRS represents a simplex case (a single affected family member) and has SRS as a result of an apparent de novo epigenetic or genetic alteration. While the majority of families are presumed to have a very low recurrence risk, SRS can occur as the result of a genetic alteration associated with up to a 50% recurrence risk depending on the nature of the genetic alteration and the sex of the transmitting parent. Rare familial cases of SRS have been reported with several underlying mechanisms, including maternally inherited 11p15 duplications, maternally inherited CDKN1C gain-of-function pathogenic variants, paternally inherited IGF2 loss-of-function pathogenic variants, paternally inherited small deletions close to the boundaries of the ICR1, and paternally or maternally inherited deletions and intragenic pathogenic variants involving PLAG1 or HMGA2. Reliable SRS recurrence risk assessment therefore requires identification of the causative genetic mechanism in the proband. Prenatal testing: Reliable prenatal testing for loss of paternal methylation at the 11p1.5 ICR1 H19/IGF2 region is not possible. Prenatal testing for the following SRS-related genetic mechanisms is possible provided the genetic mechanism has been demonstrated to be causative in an affected family member: upd(7)mat, SRS-related chromosomal abnormalities, intragenic CDKN1C, IGF2, HMGA2, or PLAG1 pathogenic variants, and deletions involving HMGA2 or PLAG1. The prenatal finding of a genetic alteration consistent with SRS cannot be used to reliably predict clinical outcome because children with SRS demonstrate varying responses to growth hormone, variable late catch-up growth, and variable developmental outcomes."

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Rhabdoid tumor predisposition syndrome (RTPS) is characterized by a markedly increased risk for the development of rhabdoid tumors rare and highly aggressive malignant tumors occurring predominantly in infants and children younger than age three years. Malignant rhabdoid tumors can occur in almost any anatomic location. They often occur in the central nervous system (i.e., atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor]); more than 50% occur in the cerebellum. Other common locations include extracranial malignant rhabdoid tumors (e.g., rhabdoid tumors of the head and neck, paravertebral muscles, liver, bladder, mediastinum, retroperitoneum, pelvis, and heart), rhabdoid tumor of the kidney, and possibly small-cell carcinoma of the ovary, hypercalcemic type (SCCOHT). More than 70% of individuals with RTPS present before age 12 months with synchronous tumors that exhibit aggressive clinical behavior. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of RTPS is established in a proband with a rhabdoid tumor and/or a family history of rhabdoid tumor and/or multiple SMARCB1- or SMARCA4-deficient tumors (synchronous or metachronous), and a heterozygous disease-causing germline variant in SMARCB1 (RTPS1) or SMARCA4 (RTPS2) identified by molecular genetic testing.

Management GeneReviews Treatment of manifestations: Because of the rarity of RTPS, standards for management are evolving. Most individuals are treated using intensive multimodal therapeutic strategies according to institutional preference combining surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. The intensive multimodal treatment strategies required for clinically aggressive tumors in children with RTPS lead to a high rate of secondary complications. Consider risk- reducing treatment strategies (e.g., postpone or replace radiotherapy with high-dose chemotherapy or proton beam therapy; use targeted therapy concomitantly with, or before, standard chemotherapy). Prevention of primary manifestations: Prophylactic risk-reducing bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy may be discussed following the end of family planning in women with SMARCA4-related RTPS because of the high risk of developing SCCOHT. The medical and ethical ramifications involved require an interdisciplinary approach including counseling and further research. Surveillance: For all individuals with a disease-causing germline variant in SMARCB1 or SMARCA4 (regardless of age), whole-body MRI should be offered at diagnosis: Birth to age six months. Monthly (or at least every 2-3 months) thorough clinical examination including neurologic examination, ultrasound of the abdomen and neck, and head ultrasound or brain and spine MRI or whole-body MRI Age seven to 18 months. Every two to three months, thorough clinical examination including neurologic examination and ultrasound of the abdomen and neck. Consider brain and spine MRI as whole-body MRI resolution may not be sufficient for brain structures. Age 19 months to five years. Every three months, thorough clinical examination including neurologic examination, ultrasound of the abdomen and neck, and brain and spine MRI. After age five years. Every six months, thorough clinical examination including neurologic examination and annual whole-body MRI. Individuals with SMARCA4-related SCCOHT should have an abdominal and pelvic ultrasound every six months. Evaluation of relatives at risk: It is appropriate to evaluate apparently asymptomatic older and younger at-risk relatives of an affected individual to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from prompt initiation of tumor surveillance. Genetic counseling RTPS is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. The vast majority of individuals with SMARCB1-related RTPS have a de novo disease-causing SMARCB1 germline variant. Most reported individuals diagnosed with SMARCA4-related RTPS inherited a disease-causing variant from a parent without a history of a rhabdoid tumor or SCCOHT. Each child of an individual with a germline SMARCB1- or SMARCA4 disease-causing variant has a 50% chance of inheriting this variant. The penetrance of SMARCB1-related RTPS may be extremely high in individuals who inherit a SMARCB1 disease-causing variant. The penetrance of SMARCA4-related RTPS appears to be incomplete. The types of RTPS-related tumors vary among family members with the same disease- causing variant. Once the SMARCB1 or SMARCA4 disease-causing variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible."

A variety of benign and malignant hematologic abnormalities have been reported in affected individuals. The rash of RTS typically develops between ages three and six months (occasionally as late as age two years) as erythema, swelling, and blistering on the face, subsequently spreading to the buttocks and extremities. The rash evolves over months to years into the chronic pattern of reticulated hypo- and hyperpigmentation, telangiectasias, and punctate atrophy (collectively known as poikiloderma) that persist throughout life. Hyperkeratotic lesions occur in approximately one third of individuals. Skeletal abnormalities can include radial ray defects, ulnar defects, absent or hypoplastic patella, and osteopenia. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of RTS is established by clinical findings (in particular, the characteristic rash) and/or the identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in ANAPC1 or RECQL4 on molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Pulsed dye laser to the telangiectatic component of the rash for cosmetic management; surgical removal of cataracts; standard treatment for cancer and/or hematologic concerns. Surveillance: Annual general physical, dermatologic, and eye examination; monitoring of health and growth, skin for lesions with unusual color or texture, for cataracts. Prompt skeletal radiographic examination when clinical suspicion of osteosarcoma is present (bone pain, swelling or enlarging lesion on a limb); however, surveillance screening for osteosarcoma is not routinely recommended.

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Sandhoff disease comprises a phenotypic continuum encompassing acute infantile, subacute juvenile, and late- onset disease. Although classification into these phenotypes is somewhat arbitrary, it is helpful in understanding the variation observed in the timing of disease onset, presenting manifestations, rate of progression, and life span. Acute infantile Sandhoff disease (onset age <6 months). Infants are generally normal at birth followed by progressive weakness and slowing of developmental progress, then developmental regression and severe neurologic impairment. Seizures are common. Death usually occurs between ages two and three years. Subacute juvenile Sandhoff disease (onset age 2-5 years). After attaining normal developmental milestones, developmental progress slows, followed by developmental regression and neurologic impairment (abnormal gait, dysarthria, and cognitive decline). Death (usually from aspiration) typically occurs in the early to late teens. Late-onset Sandhoff disease (onset older teen years or young adulthood). Nearly normal psychomotor development is followed by a range of neurologic findings (e.g., weakness, spasticity, dysarthria, and deficits in cerebellar function) and psychiatric findings (e.g., deficits in executive function and memory). Life expectancy is not necessarily decreased. Diagnosis/testing In a proband, the diagnosis of Sandhoff disease is established by: (1) enzymatic testing that identifies abnormally low activity of the enzymes beta-hexosaminidase A (HEX A) and beta-hexosaminidase B (HEX B) combined with an increased contribution from HEX A; and (2) identification biallelic pathogenic variants in HEXB on molecular testing.

Management GeneReviews Treatment of manifestations: Treatment is symptomatic. Supportive care in acute infantile Sandhoff disease focuses on providing adequate nutrition and hydration, managing infectious disease, protecting the airway to reduce aspiration risk, controlling seizures, supporting motor development, and preventing deformities. Supportive care in subacute juvenile and late-onset Sandhoff disease focuses on maximizing motor function and speech and language as well as providing aids for activities of daily living and communication. Surveillance: Periodic multidisciplinary evaluations to monitor existing disease manifestations and identify new manifestations requiring modification of supportive care. Agents/circumstances to avoid: In acute infantile Sandhoff disease, avoid positioning that increases aspiration risk during feedings; and seizure medication dosages that result in excessive sedation. In subacute juvenile Sandhoff disease, avoid situations that increase the likelihood of contractures or pressure sores, such as extended periods of immobility; and circumstances that increase the risk of falling. In late-onset Sandhoff disease, avoid situations that increase the risk of falling (e.g., walking on uneven or unstable surfaces); and psychiatric medications that have been associated with worsening disease in late-onset Tay-Sachs disease, a similar disorder (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone, chlorpromazine). Genetic counseling Sandhoff disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner.

Speech delay and/or absent speech is observed in all affected individuals. Other neurobehavioral manifestations can include jovial or friendly personality, autistic tendencies, agitation or aggressive outbursts, self-injury, impulsivity, hyperactivity, anxiety, difficulty falling asleep or maintaining sleep, and sensory issues. Most affected individuals have hypotonia. EEG abnormalities are frequent but may be without clinically recognizable seizures. While only about 20% of affected individuals have clinical seizures, a subset of affected individuals have electrical status epilepticus in sleep. Craniofacial findings can include nonspecific dysmorphic features, palatal anomalies (cleft palate, high-arched palate, velopharyngeal insufficiency, bifid uvula), and dental anomalies (abnormal shape or size or the upper central incisors, dental crowding, hypodontia, and delayed teeth eruption, among others). Skeletal anomalies can include scoliosis, tibial bowing, and joint contractures. At least one third of individuals have a history of previous fractures and about one quarter of affected individuals have documented low bone mineral density. Other finding can include pre- and postnatal growth restriction, feeding issues, and eye anomalies (strabismus, refractive error).

Early in the disease, affected individuals may have gait disturbance, slurred speech, difficulty with balance, brisk deep tendon reflexes, hypermetric saccades, nystagmus, and mild dysphagia. Later signs include slowing of saccadic velocity, development of upgaze palsy, dysmetria, dysdiadochokinesia, and hypotonia. In advanced stages, muscle atrophy, decreased deep tendon reflexes, loss of proprioception, cognitive impairment (e.g., frontal executive dysfunction, impaired verbal memory), chorea, dystonia, and bulbar dysfunction are seen. Onset is typically in the third or fourth decade, although childhood onset and late-adult onset have been reported. Those with onset after age 60 years may manifest a pure cerebellar phenotype. Interval from onset to death varies from ten to 30 years; individuals with juvenile onset show more rapid progression and more severe disease. Anticipation is observed. An axonal sensory neuropathy detected by electrophysiologic testing is common; brain imaging typically shows cerebellar and brain stem atrophy.

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 (SCA10) is characterized by slowly progressive cerebellar ataxia that usually starts as poor balance and unsteady gait, followed by upper-limb ataxia, scanning dysarthria, and dysphagia. Abnormal tracking eye movements are common. Recurrent seizures after the onset of gait ataxia have been reported with variable frequencies among different families. Some individuals have cognitive dysfunction, behavioral disturbances, mood disorders, mild pyramidal signs, and peripheral neuropathy. Age of onset ranges from 12 to 48 years. Diagnosis/testing Diagnosis of SCA10 is established in a proband by identification of a heterozygous ATTCT pentanucleotide- repeat expansion in ATXN10. Affected individuals have expanded alleles with up to 4,500 ATTCT pentanucleotide repeats; intermediate alleles (280 to 850 repeats) may show reduced penetrance. Management Treatment of manifestations: Treatment is primarily focused on control of seizures, as uncontrolled seizures may lead to potentially fatal status epilepticus. Conventional anticonvulsants such as levetiracetam, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and valproic acid achieve reasonable control, although occasional breakthrough seizures may occur. Treatment measures for ataxia: canes / walkers / mobilized chairs; standard home modifications; exercise and physical therapy; and weight control to avoid difficulty with ambulation and mobility. For dysphagia: percutaneous placement of a gastrostomy tube for both prevention of aspiration and maintenance of nutritional intake; vitamin supplementation. For dysarthria: speech therapy and speech/communication assistive devices. Weighted utensils and dressing hooks for upper-limb coordination issues. Mild tranquilizers may be helpful for those with anxiety.

Psychiatric symptoms, pyramidal signs, and rigidity are common. The age of onset ranges from three to 55 years. Individuals with full-penetrance alleles develop neurologic and/or psychiatric symptoms by age 50 years. Ataxia and psychiatric abnormalities are frequently the initial findings, followed by involuntary movement, parkinsonism, dementia, and pyramidal signs. Brain MRI shows variable atrophy of the cerebrum, brain stem, and cerebellum.

Approximately two thirds of those affected also display palatal tremor (\\\"myoclonus\\\") and/or abnormal phonation clinically resembling spasmodic adductor dysphonia. Dysarthria, which may be abrupt in onset, precedes the onset of ataxia in about two thirds of affected individuals, sometimes by a number of years. Hypermetric horizontal saccades (without nystagmus or disturbance of vestibulo-ocular reflex gain) are seen in about half of affected persons. Although minor pyramidal signs (brisk knee jerks, crossed adductor spread) may be seen, spasticity and extensor plantar responses are not. Cognition is normal. Clinical information is based on the findings in 16 personally examined affected members of a single Australian family of Anglo-Celtic descent. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of SCA20 is based on clinical findings and neuroimaging. Within five years of disease onset CT scan shows pronounced dentate calcification, typically without concomitant pallidal calcification. In addition to evidence of dentate calcification, MRI shows mild-to-moderate pan cerebellar atrophy and normal cerebrum and brain stem (except for increased inferior olivary T2 signal in those with palatal tremor). The locus for SCA20 lies within the pericentromeric region of chromosome 11; the gene is unknown.

Brain MRI shows atrophy of the cerebellar vermis in initial stages, later evolving to a pattern of olivopontocerebellar atrophy. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis is suspected based on clinical findings in the absence of primary causes of cerebellar dysfunction. It is supported by a family history consistent with autosomal dominant inheritance, which can include simplex cases (i.e., a single occurrence in a family).

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Spinocerebellar ataxia type 38 (SCA38) is characterized as a pure cerebellar ataxia with symptoms typically manifesting in the fourth decade of life. The most common presenting features are nystagmus and slowly progressive gait ataxia. As the disease progresses, cerebellar symptoms (limb ataxia, dysarthria, dysphagia, diplopia on the horizontal line) may emerge, and affected individuals may experience sensory loss. In the later stages of the condition, ophthalmoparesis followed by ophthalmoplegia may occur. Features that distinguish SCA38 from other spinocerebellar ataxias include pes cavus without paresis, hyposmia, hearing loss, and anxiety disorder. Dementia and extrapyramidal signs are not common features of SCA38. Brain imaging typically demonstrates cerebellar atrophy mainly affecting the vermis without atrophy of the cerebral cortex and a normal appearance of the brain stem. With disease progression, nerve conduction velocities and electromyography demonstrate a sensory and motor axonal polyneuropathy in all four extremities. Life span is apparently not decreased. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of SCA38 is established in a proband with progressive gait ataxia and a heterozygous pathogenic variant in ELOVL5 identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Management remains supportive and may include physical therapy to ameliorate coordination difficulties; crutches and walkers; home adaptations to avoid falls or accommodate motorized chairs; speech-language therapy; weighted utensils; hearing aids for those with hearing loss; and standard therapy for anxiety.

Therapies under investigation: Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) supplementation (600 mg/day) may improve clinical symptoms and cerebellar hypometabolism; no data on the effectiveness of DHA in postponing signs and symptoms of SCA38 in asymptomatic individuals with a heterozygous pathogenic variant in ELOVL5 have been published. Genetic counseling Spinocerebellar ataxia type 38 (SCA38) is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. All reported individuals diagnosed with SCA38 have an affected parent. The offspring of an affected individual are at 50% risk of inheriting the ELOVL5 pathogenic variant. Prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk is possible if the pathogenic variant in the family is known; however, requests for prenatal diagnosis of adult-onset diseases are uncommon and require careful genetic counseling."

Anticipation in this nucleotide repeat disorder may be so dramatic that within a family a child with infantile or early-childhood onset may be diagnosed with what is thought to be an unrelated neurodegenerative disorder years before a parent or grandparent with a CAG repeat expansion becomes symptomatic. In adolescent-onset SCA7, the initial manifestation is typically impaired vision, followed by cerebellar ataxia. In those with adult onset, progressive cerebellar ataxia usually precedes the onset of visual manifestations. While the rate of progression varies in these two age groups, the eventual result for almost all affected individuals is loss of vision, severe dysarthria and dysphagia, and a bedridden state with loss of motor control. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of SCA7 is established in a proband by the identification of a heterozygous abnormal CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in ATXN7 by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Multidisciplinary care involves supportive treatment of: neurologic manifestations physical and occupational therapy to help maintain mobility and function, and pharmacologic treatment to reduce symptoms; dysarthria speech and language therapy and alternative communication methods; dysphagia feeding therapy to improve nutrition and reduce the risk of aspiration; and reduced vision use of low vision aids and consultation with agencies for the visually impaired.

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Most infants with short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (SCADD) identified through newborn screening programs have remained well, and asymptomatic relatives who meet diagnostic criteria are reported. Thus, SCADD is now viewed as a biochemical phenotype rather than a disease. A broad range of clinical findings was originally reported in those with confirmed SCADD, including severe dysmorphic facial features, feeding difficulties / failure to thrive, metabolic acidosis, ketotic hypoglycemia, lethargy, developmental delay, seizures, hypotonia, dystonia, and myopathy. However, individuals with no symptoms were also reported. In a large series of affected individuals detected on metabolic evaluation for developmental delay, 20% had failure to thrive, feeding difficulties, and hypotonia; 22% had seizures; and 30% had hypotonia without seizures. In contrast, the majority of infants with SCADD have been detected by expanded newborn screening, and the great majority of these infants remain asymptomatic. As with other fatty acid oxidation deficiencies, characteristic biochemical findings of SCADD may be absent except during times of physiologic stress such as fasting and illness. A diagnosis of SCADD based on clinical findings should not preclude additional testing to look for other causes. Diagnosis/testing SCADD has been defined as the presence of: Increased butyrylcarnitine (C4) concentrations in plasma and/or increased ethylmalonic acid (EMA) concentrations in urine under non-stressed conditions (on at least two occasions); AND Biallelic ACADS pathogenic variants.

There are no generally accepted recommendations for dietary manipulation or use of carnitine and/or riboflavin supplementation. Prevention of primary manifestations: No preventive measures are necessary. Surveillance: Longitudinal follow up of persons with SCADD on a research basis may be helpful in order to more clearly define the natural history over the life span, including annual visits to a metabolic clinic to assess growth and development as well as nutritional status (protein and iron stores, concentration of RBC or plasma essential fatty acids, and plasma carnitine concentration). Genetic counseling SCADD is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. At conception, each sib of an individual with SCADD has a 25% chance of inheriting biallelic ACADS pathogenic or susceptibility variants and possibly developing clinical findings associated with SCADD, a 50% chance of being a carrier of an ACADS pathogenic variant, and a 25% chance of not being a carrier. If the pathogenic variants in the family have been identified, carrier testing for at-risk family members is possible, and prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible but not necessary and not recommended."

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Schaaf-Yang syndrome (SYS) is a rare neurodevelopmental disorder that shares multiple clinical features with the genetically related Prader-Willi syndrome. It usually manifests at birth with muscular hypotonia in all and distal joint contractures in a majority of affected individuals. Gastrointestinal/feeding problems are particularly pronounced in infancy and childhood, but can transition to hyperphagia and obesity in adulthood. Respiratory distress is present in many individuals at birth, with approximately half requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation, and approximately 20% requiring tracheostomy. Skeletal manifestations such as joint contractures, scoliosis, and decreased bone mineral density are frequently observed. All affected individuals show developmental delay, resulting in intellectual disability of variable degree, from low-normal intelligence to severe intellectual disability. Other findings may include short stature, seizures, eye anomalies, and hypogonadism. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of Schaaf-Yang syndrome is established in a proband by identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in the paternally derived MAGEL2 allele by molecular genetic testing. The 15q11.2 locus that includes MAGEL2 is maternally imprinted, meaning that only the paternally derived allele is expressed while the maternally derived allele is inactivated. Management Treatment of manifestations: Feeding therapy or supplemental tube feeding may be required for persistent feeding issues; assisted ventilation to include either noninvasive or invasive intervention; CPAP for sleep apnea; growth hormone therapy in those with short stature and/or linear growth concerns; standard therapy for gastroesophageal reflux disease, metabolic syndrome, constipation, skeletal abnormalities, low bone mineral density, developmental delay/cognitive impairment, seizures, eye anomalies, undescended testes, hypogonadism and pubertal abnormalities, and hypothyroidism.

GeneReviews Surveillance: At each visit: measurement of growth parameters and evaluation of nutritional status & safety of oral intake; assessment of developmental progress, educational needs, and self-help skills; monitor for signs and symptoms of constipation, sleep apnea, respiratory insufficiency, scoliosis, progression of contractures, and puberty (from ages 10-17 years). Behavioral assessment annually; DXA scan every two years starting at the age five years, transitioning to every three to five years in adulthood; ophthalmology evaluation as recommended by an ophthalmologist; polysomnography annually for those on long-term GH therapy or as recommended by a sleep specialist. Genetic counseling Schaaf-Yang syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant, maternally imprinted manner (i.e., a heterozygous pathogenic variant on the paternally derived MAGEL2 allele results in disease; a pathogenic variant on the maternally derived MAGEL2 allele does not result in disease because normally the maternally derived MAGEL2 allele is silenced). Approximately 50% of individuals diagnosed with SYS inherited a MAGEL2 pathogenic variant from a clinically unaffected father and the remainder are de novo. If the father of the proband is heterozygous for the MAGEL2 pathogenic variant identified in the proband, the risk to both male and female sibs is 50%. The recurrence risk within the family of the proband's mother is that of the general population. Once the MAGEL2 pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible."

Other findings can include poor weight gain often associated with gastroesophageal reflux disease, chronic vomiting, constipation, gastroparesis, and/or feeding intolerance. Structural malformations can involve the heart, skeleton, kidney and urinary tract, genitalia, and brain. Anomalies of the liver, spleen, and/or pancreas are less common. Other features may include neuroepithelial neoplasia, severely disrupted sleep, choanal stenosis, inguinal hernia, sensitive skin, and increased risk of infection. To date, more than 50 individuals have been reported with molecularly confirmed classic SGS. Atypical SGS, reported in five individuals to date, is caused by pathogenic SETBP1 variants in proximity to but not within the mutational hot spot. The broad spectrum of clinical features of variable severity partially overlaps with classic SGS; however, this spectrum does not include risk for neuroepithelial neoplasia to date. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of classic SGS can be established in a proband based on published clinical diagnostic criteria, or the molecular diagnosis can be established in a proband with suggestive findings and a heterozygous SETBP1 pathogenic gain-of-function variant within the mutational hot spot (i.e., a 12-base-pair region in exon 4 encoding a canonical degron). The diagnosis of atypical SGS syndrome is established in a proband with suggestive findings and a heterozygous SETBP1 pathogenic variant adjacent to but not within the mutational hot spot.

Management GeneReviews Treatment of manifestations: There is no cure for classic or atypical SGS. Supportive treatment to improve quality of life, maximize function, and reduce complications can include multidisciplinary care by specialists in pediatrics, neurology, physiatry, occupational and physical therapy, speech-language pathology, psychiatry, ophthalmology, ENT, surgery, pulmonology, oncology, urology, nephrology, audiology, gastroenterology, orthopedics, cardiology, and medical genetics. Surveillance: At each visit, evaluate for feeding issues (including nutritional status and safety of oral intake), gastrointestinal issues, respiratory issues, neurologic manifestations (including seizures, changes in tone, movement disorders, mood, irritability, and alertness), kidney and urinary tract manifestations, and musculoskeletal manifestations. In individuals with classic SGS, age-related surveillance for occurrence of neoplasia includes liver ultrasound and serum alpha-fetoprotein levels, renal ultrasound examination, pelvic MRI for sacrococcygeal teratoma, and monitoring for clinical signs of leukemia. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Nephrotoxic drugs such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and vancomycin should be used with caution due to high frequency of chronic renal impairment from recurrent pyelonephritis and structural renal anomalies. Genetic counseling Classic and atypical SGS are autosomal dominant disorders typically caused by a de novo SETBP1 pathogenic variant. Rarely, individuals diagnosed with SGS have the disorder as the result of a pathogenic variant inherited from a parent. Sib recurrence of clinically defined classic SGS, presumed to be due to parental germline mosaicism, has been reported in two families. Transmission of a SETBP1 pathogenic missense variant from an unaffected parent to a child with atypical SGS has been reported in one family (of note, the possibility of mosaicism in the unaffected parent was not excluded). Once the SETBP1 pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing are possible."

Affected individuals may have (a) developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE) (i.e., intractable seizures with developmental delays associated with ongoing epileptiform EEG activity) with or without malformations of cortical development; or (b) malformations of cortical development with or without mild focal epilepsy. Some degree of early childhood developmental delay is seen in all affected individuals; the severity varies widely, ranging from isolated speech delay to severe developmental delay. Infantile hypotonia is common but may be mild or absent in those without DEE. In those with DEE, seizure onset is typically in the first six to 12 months of life. A variety of seizure types have been described. Seizures remain intractable to multiple anti-seizure medications in approximately 50% of individuals with DEE without malformations of cortical development (MCD) and in 90% of individuals with DEE and MCD. Seizures may be absent or infrequent in those without DEE. Brain MRI findings range from normal to showing thinning or hypoplasia of the corpus callosum, to various malformations of cortical development. Autonomic dysregulation, oromotor dysfunction leading to the need for gastrostomy tube placement, progressive microcephaly, hyperkinetic movement disorder, and cortical visual impairment can also be seen in those with DEE.

The risk of an adverse outcome to the fetus from anti-seizure medication exposure is often less than that associated with exposure to an untreated maternal seizure disorder. Discussion of the risks and benefits of using a given anti-seizure medication during pregnancy should ideally take place prior to conception. Transitioning to a lower-risk medication prior to pregnancy may be possible. Genetic counseling SCN3A-ND is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. The majority of probands diagnosed with SCN3A- ND have the disorder as the result of a de novo pathogenic variant. If a parent of the proband is affected and/or is known to have the SCN3A pathogenic variant identified in the proband, the risk to the sibs of inheriting the pathogenic variant is 50%. Once the SCN3A pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible."

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics SCN8A-related epilepsy and/or neurodevelopmental disorders encompasses a spectrum of phenotypes. Epilepsy phenotypes include developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE) associated with severe developmental delays and usually pharmacoresistant epilepsy with multiple seizure types; mild-to-moderate developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (mild/modDEE, or intermediate epilepsy) with partially treatable epilepsy; self-limited familial infantile epilepsy (SeLFIE, also known as benign familial infantile epilepsy or BFIE) with normal cognition and medically treatable seizures; neurodevelopmental delays with generalized epilepsy (NDDwGE); and neurodevelopmental disorder without epilepsy (NDDwoE) with mild-to-moderate intellectual disability (though it can be severe in ~10% of affected individuals). Hypotonia and movement disorders including dystonia, ataxia, and choreoathetosis are common in some phenotypes. Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) has been reported in some affected individuals. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of SCN8A-related epilepsy and/or neurodevelopmental disorders is established in a proband with suggestive findings and a heterozygous pathogenic variant in SCN8A identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Targeted therapy: Several studies suggest a favorable response to sodium channel blockers in the SCN8A-related epilepsy phenotypes of SCN8A-DEE, SCN8A-mild/modDEE, and SCN8A-SeLFIE. Supportive care: Seizure control should be managed by a pediatric neurologist with expertise in epilepsy management who is familiar with the pharmacotherapy for SCN8A-related epilepsy and aware of how it differs from treatment of similar disorders. Vigorous attempts to control seizures are warranted.

Surveillance: Periodic evaluations for neurologic, cognitive, and/or behavioral deterioration; monitoring with EEG and other modalities such as video EEG telemetry or ambulatory EEG when new or different seizure types are suspected. Because of the increased risk of SUDEP, monitoring seizures in individuals at higher risk, including those with generalized tonic-clonic seizures and/or nighttime seizures, is warranted. Evaluation of relatives at risk: It is appropriate to clarify the genetic status of apparently asymptomatic older and younger at-risk relatives of an affected individual in order to identify those who are at risk for developing seizures. This typically entails targeted molecular genetic testing for the known pathogenic variant(s) in the family. Pregnancy management: Pregnant women should receive counseling regarding the risks and benefits of using anti-seizure medications during pregnancy; the advantages and disadvantages of increasing maternal periconceptional folic acid supplementation to 4,000 g daily; the effects of pregnancy on anti-seizure medication metabolism; and the effect of pregnancy on maternal seizure control. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Several families report worsening of seizures with levetiracetam. Genetic counseling SCN8A-related epilepsy and/or neurodevelopmental disorders are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Individuals with more severe SCN8A-related phenotypes are more likely to have the disorder as the result of a de novo pathogenic variant than individuals with milder SCN8A-related phenotypes. Each child of an individual with SCN8A-related epilepsy and/or neurodevelopmental disorders has a 50% chance of inheriting the SCN8A pathogenic variant. Once the SCN8A pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing are possible."

Syndactyly of digits two and three of the hand is variably present. Cognitive development is usually normal, although those with a large genomic deletion are at an increased risk for intellectual challenges. Less common manifestations of SCS include other skeletal findings (parietal foramina, vertebral segmentation defects, radioulnar synostosis, maxillary hypoplasia, ocular hypertelorism, hallux valgus, duplicated or curved distal hallux), hypertelorism, palatal anomalies, obstructive sleep apnea, increased intracranial pressure, short stature, and congenital heart malformations. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of SCS is established in a proband with typical clinical findings and a heterozygous pathogenic (or likely pathogenic) variant in TWIST1 identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Ongoing management by an established craniofacial team which may include cranioplasty in the first year of life and midface surgery in childhood as needed for dental malocclusion, swallowing difficulties, and respiratory problems. If a cleft palate is present, surgical repair usually follows cranioplasty. As needed: orthodontic treatment and/or orthognathic surgery at the completion of facial growth; developmental intervention; routine treatment of hearing loss; ophthalmologic evaluation and, if ptosis is present, intervention to prevent amblyopia, with surgical repair during early childhood as needed.

Additional findings include poorly characterized immunodeficiency, recurrent infections, skin abnormalities, and liver disease. Mild intellectual disability (ID) is seen in about 50% of affected individuals. Less common findings include congenital heart defects and platelet anomalies. To date 52 affected individuals have been reported. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of THES is established in a proband with biallelic pathogenic variants in either SKIC3 (formerly TTC37) or SKIC2 (formerly SKIV2L). Management Treatment of manifestations: To promote maximal weight gain and linear growth, most children initially require parenteral nutrition (PN). As tolerated, oral feeding (typically a semi-elemental diet) can be combined with PN. On the rare occasion that PN is unnecessary, anecdotal reports describe use of mainly an amino acid-based formula. To reduce the burden of infections, immunoglobulins can be supplemented in those with low immunoglobulin levels or immunoglobulin functional abnormalities.

In almost all affected children, persistent or intermittent neutropenia is an early finding. Short stature and recurrent infections are common. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of SDS is established in a proband with the classic clinical findings of exocrine pancreatic dysfunction and bone marrow dysfunction and/or biallelic pathogenic variants in DNAJC21, EFL1, or SBDS or a heterozygous pathogenic variant in SRP54 identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Care by a multidisciplinary team is highly recommended. Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency is treated with oral pancreatic enzymes and fat-soluble vitamin supplementation. Blood and/or platelet transfusions may be considered for anemia and thrombocytopenia. If recurrent infections are severe and absolute neutrophil counts are persistently 500/mm3, treatment with granulocyte-colony stimulation factor (G- CSF) can be considered and may be especially helpful when interventions such as complex dental procedures or orthopedic surgery are being considered. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) should be considered for treatment of severe bone marrow failure, MDS, or AML. Early pulmonary and orthopedic referral is essential for treatment of thoracic dystrophy; orthopedic management of other skeletal manifestations including skeletal dysplasia, asymmetric growth, and joint deformities.

GeneReviews Surveillance: Assessment of nutritional status and measurement of serum concentration of fat-soluble vitamins every six months. Complete blood count with white blood cell differential and platelet count at least every three to six months; bone marrow examination every one to three years or more frequently if bone marrow changes are observed. Monitor for orthopedic complications with radiographs of the hips and knees during the most rapid growth stages. Bone densitometry before puberty, during puberty, and thereafter based on individual findings. Development assessment every six months from birth to age six years; neuropsychological screening in children ages six to eight years, eleven to 13 years, and 15 to 17 years.

Agents/circumstances to avoid: Prolonged use of cytokine and hematopoietic growth factors (e.g., G-CSF) should be considered with caution. Some drugs used in standard HSCT preparative regimens (e.g., cyclophosphamide and busulfan) may not be suitable because of possible cardiac toxicity. Evaluation of relatives at risk: It is appropriate to evaluate the older and younger sibs of a proband in order to identify those who will benefit from treatment and preventive measures as soon as possible. It is essential to evaluate any potential related donor for SDS to avoid using an asymptomatic relative with SDS as an HSCT donor. Pregnancy management: High-risk pregnancy care including consultation with a hematologist. Genetic counseling SDS is inherited in an autosomal recessive (most commonly) or an autosomal dominant manner. Autosomal recessive SDS: SDS caused by pathogenic variants in DNAJC21, EFL1, or SBDS is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Most parents of children with autosomal recessive SDS are heterozygotes (carriers of one pathogenic variant); however, de novo pathogenic variants have been reported. If both parents are known to be heterozygous for an autosomal recessive SDS-related pathogenic variant, each sib of an affected individual has at conception a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being a clinically asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Carrier testing for relatives at risk is possible if both pathogenic variants in a family are known. Autosomal dominant SDS: SDS caused by pathogenic variants in SRP54 is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Most individuals diagnosed with SRP54-related SDS have the disorder as the result of a de novo pathogenic variant. Once the SDS-related pathogenic variant(s) have been identified in an affected family member, prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing are possible."

At birth, affected males are normal in length and have normal body proportions. Affected males exhibit linear growth deficiency beginning around age six to eight years. Final adult height is typically 137-163 cm. Progressive joint and back pain with osteoarthritis ensues; hip, knee, and shoulder joints are commonly involved but to a variable degree. Hip replacement is often required as early as age 40 years. Interphalangeal joints are typically spared. Motor and cognitive milestones are normal. Diagnosis/testing The clinical diagnosis of X-linked SEDT can be established in a male proband with characteristic radiographic findings (which typically appear prior to puberty) including: multiple epiphyseal abnormalities, platyspondyly with characteristic superior and inferior \\\"humping\\\" seen on lateral view, scoliosis, hypoplastic odontoid process, short femoral necks, and coxa vara; evidence of premature osteoarthritis appears in young adulthood. The molecular diagnosis of X-linked SEDT can be established in a male proband with suggestive findings and a hemizygous pathogenic variant in TRAPPC2 identified by molecular genetic testing. The molecular diagnosis of X-linked SEDT can be established in a female proband with osteoarthritis and a heterozygous pathogenic variant in TRAPPC2 identified by molecular genetic testing.

Evaluation of relatives at risk: Presymptomatic testing in males at risk may obviate unnecessary diagnostic testing for other causes of short stature and/or osteoarthritis. Genetic counseling By definition, X-linked SEDT is inherited in an X-linked manner. When performed, molecular genetic testing of all mothers of affected sons determined that regardless of family history all were carriers of a pathogenic variant in TRAPPC2. Carrier females are at a 50% risk of transmitting the TRAPPC2 pathogenic variant in each pregnancy: males who inherit the pathogenic variant will be affected; females who inherit the pathogenic variant will be carriers and will not be affected. None of the sons of an affected male will be affected; all daughters will be carriers of the TRAPPC2 pathogenic variant.

Clinical characteristics Sialuria is characterized by variable and transient signs and symptoms, especially in infancy. These include slightly flat and coarse facies, prolonged neonatal jaundice, equivocal or mild hepatomegaly, microcytic anemia, frequent upper respiratory infections, and episodes of gastroenteritis, dehydration, and transient failure to thrive. Mild developmental delay and hypotonia have been neither consistent nor permanent. Learning difficulty and seizures have been observed later in childhood. Sialuria has been detected retrospectively in an adult without subjective signs or complaints of disease. The long-term outcome of the disorder is unknown to date. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of sialuria is suggested by highly elevated urinary excretion of free sialic acid using the spectrophotometric or fluorimetric thiobarbituric acid assay or thin-layer chromatography. The diagnosis is formally established by demonstration of significantly raised free sialic acid within the cytoplasm of parenchymal cells or cultured fibroblasts. GNE is the only gene in which mutation is known to cause sialuria. Management Treatment of manifestations: Persons with sialuria need symptomatic and supportive management, including treatment of anemia, prolonged jaundice, and convulsions. Barbiturates are more effective than other antiepileptic drugs in treating the occasional convulsions in early childhood. Children with sialuria benefit from early developmental intervention and appropriate educational programs. Surveillance: Follow-up evaluations three to four times in infancy, twice in the second year of life, and once every subsequent year.

Pregnancy management: Gestational hypertension, diabetes, preeclampsia, fetal distress, and preterm labor have all been reported in mothers of individuals with SGBS1. Fetal macrocephaly and overgrowth may necessitate cesarean delivery or early induction of labor. Genetic counseling SGBS1 is inherited in an X-linked manner. If the mother of the proband has a pathogenic variant, the chance of transmitting the pathogenic variant in each pregnancy is 50%. Males who inherit the pathogenic variant will be affected. Females who inherit the pathogenic variant will be carriers, although due to X-chromosome inactivation, carrier females may have manifestations of SGBS1. Males with SGBS1 will pass the pathogenic variant to all their daughters and none of their sons. Carrier testing for at-risk relatives and prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk are possible for families in which the pathogenic variant has been identified."

It is now recognized that the features most consistently observed in SHORT syndrome are mild intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR); mild to moderate short stature; partial lipodystrophy (evident in the face, and later in the chest and upper extremities, often sparing the buttocks and legs); and a characteristic facial gestalt. Insulin resistance may be evident in mid-childhood or adolescence, although diabetes mellitus typically does not develop until early adulthood. Other frequent features include Axenfeld- Rieger anomaly or related ocular anterior chamber dysgenesis, delayed dentition and other dental issues, and sensorineural hearing loss. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of SHORT syndrome is established in a proband with compatible clinical features (with emphasis on the facial gestalt) and a heterozygous pathogenic variant in PIK3R1 identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Glaucoma: reduce and stabilize intraocular pressure and to preserve vision. Sensorineural hearing loss: use of hearing aids. Dental anomalies: standard treatment; may include crowns and dental prostheses. Glucose intolerance and diabetes mellitus: to be followed by an endocrine specialist. Surveillance: Regular monitoring of growth including height, weight, and body mass index. For all individuals with and without apparent anterior chamber anomaly: routine eye examinations to include measurement of intraocular pressure. Hearing assessment every two to three years. Screening for insulin resistance by oral glucose tolerance test every five years in the absence of diabetes. Annual screening lab tests for diabetes mellitus beginning after age ten years.

    "_id": "sickle",
    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Sickle cell disease (SCD) is characterized by intermittent vaso-occlusive events and chronic hemolytic anemia. Vaso-occlusive events result in tissue ischemia leading to acute and chronic pain as well as organ damage that can affect any organ system, including the bones, spleen, liver, brain, lungs, kidneys, and joints. Dactylitis (pain and/or swelling of the hands or feet) is often the earliest manifestation of SCD. In children, the spleen can become engorged with blood cells in a \\\"splenic sequestration.\\\" The spleen is particularly vulnerable to infarction and the majority of individuals with SCD who are not on hydroxyurea or transfusion therapy become functionally asplenic in early childhood, increasing their risk for certain types of bacterial infections, primarily encapsulated organisms. Acute chest syndrome (ACS) is a major cause of mortality in SCD. Chronic hemolysis can result in varying degrees of anemia, jaundice, cholelithiasis, and delayed growth and sexual maturation as well as activating pathways that contribute to the pathophysiology directly. Individuals with the highest rates of hemolysis are at higher risk for pulmonary artery hypertension, priapism, and leg ulcers and may be relatively protected from vaso-occlusive pain. Diagnosis/testing SCD encompasses a group of disorders characterized by the presence of at least one hemoglobin S allele (HbS; p.Glu6Val in HBB) and a second HBB pathogenic variant resulting in abnormal hemoglobin polymerization. Hb S/S (homozygous p.Glu6Val in HBB) accounts for the majority of SCD. Other forms of SCD result from compound heterozygosity for HbS with other specific pathogenic beta globin chain variants (e.g., sickle- hemoglobin C disease [Hb S/C], sickle beta-thalassemia [Hb S/+-thalassemia and Hb S/0-thalassemia], Hb S/D, Hb S/OArab, Hb S/E). The diagnosis of SCD is established by identification of significant quantities of HbS with or without an additional abnormal beta globin chain variant by hemoglobin assay or by identification of biallelic HBB pathogenic variants including at least one p.Glu6Val allele (e.g., homozygous p.Glu6Val; p.Glu6Val and a second HBB pathogenic variant) on molecular genetic testing.

GeneReviews Newborn screening for SCD began in the United States in 1975 in New York and expanded to include all 50 states by 2006. Newborn screening programs perform isoelectric focusing and/or high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) of an eluate of dried blood spots. Some newborn screening programs confirm results with molecular testing. Management Targeted therapies: Disease-modulating pharmacotherapies (hydroxyurea, L-glutamine, voxelotor, and crizanlizumab); hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; gene therapy. Supportive care: Education of parents, caregivers, and affected individuals on avoidance of potential triggers of vaso-occlusion (dehydration, climate extremes, overexertion, and, when possible, trauma and infection), health maintenance, prophylactic medications, early interventions, warning signs of acute illness, pain management options, and urgent care plan; antibiotic prophylaxis for Streptococcus pneumoni; immunizations including those for asplenic individuals; folic acid supplementation; red blood cell (RBC) transfusion therapy and treatment for iron overload. Management of pain episodes includes reversal of inciting triggers, hydration, anti- inflammatory agents, and pain medication. Pain episodes are additionally managed with a multimodal approach (e.g., warmth, massage, distraction, acupuncture, biofeedback, self-hypnosis). RBC transfusion as needed for splenic sequestration; splenectomy may be necessary. Fever and suspected infection are treated with appropriate antibiotics. Life-threatening or severe complications (e.g., severe ACS, stroke, aplastic crisis, chronic kidney failure) are often treated with RBC transfusion or RBC exchange. Treatment of pulmonary hypertension generally includes treating inciting factors and optimizing SCD therapy to stop progression; severe priapism may require aspiration and irrigation. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers for those with kidney disease with kidney transplant for end-stage kidney disease; mental health therapy and community resources. Surveillance: Periodic comprehensive medical and social evaluation, mental health and neurocognitive assessment, and routine dental care. Annual complete blood count with differential and reticulocyte count; annual transcranial Doppler to determine risk of stroke in all children with Hb S/S and Hb S/0-thalassemia; annual developmental assessment throughout childhood; neurocognitive assessment prior to school entry and as needed; brain MRI in childhood when examination can be tolerated without anesthesia and repeated as needed; annual assessment of vitamin D level and renal function (blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, urinalysis, and urine microalbumin or urine protein-to-creatinine ratio); ophthalmologic evaluation annually beginning at age ten years. Because of the high frequency and severity of cardiopulmonary complications there should be a particularly low threshold to obtain an echocardiogram, pulmonary function tests, six-minute walk test, N- terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), and sleep study in individuals of any age with cardiac or pulmonary concerns; EKG in those on medications that may alter corrected QT interval; growth assessments throughout childhood; annual assessment of iron status and liver function; MRI as needed to evaluate for iron overload; assessment of mental health and social needs at least annually. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Dehydration, extremes of temperature, physical exhaustion, extremely high altitude, trauma, infection, recreational drugs with vasoconstrictive or cardiac stimulation effects, and meperidine. Evaluation of relatives at risk: Early diagnosis of at-risk family members allows for genetic counseling as well as education and intervention before symptoms or end-organ damage are present. Pregnancy management: Women with SCD who become pregnant require close follow up and monitoring by a hematologist and obstetrician. Increased risk for preterm labor, thrombosis, preeclampsia, infectious complications, ACS, and acute painful episodes have been reported during pregnancy. Hydroxyurea should be discontinued during pregnancy. Cell Disease 3 Genetic counseling SCD is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. If both parents are known to be heterozygous for an HBB pathogenic variant, each sib of an affected individual has at conception a 25% chance of inheriting biallelic beta globin chain variants and being affected, a 50% chance of inheriting one beta globin chain variant and being heterozygous, and a 25% chance of inheriting neither of the familial beta globin chain variants. If the SCD- related HBB pathogenic variants in a family are known, molecular genetic testing can be used to identify which at-risk family members are heterozygous; if only one (or neither) SCD-related HBB pathogenic variant in a family is known, HPLC can be used to detect common qualitative abnormalities (i.e., abnormal hemoglobins). Molecular genetic prenatal testing and preimplantation genetic testing for SCD are possible when both HBB pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member and the genetic status of the parents is known."

Clinical characteristics X-linked sideroblastic anemia and ataxia (XLSA/A) is characterized by moderate anemia and early-onset spinocerebellar syndrome in males, manifest primarily as delayed walking, ataxia evident in early childhood, dysmetria, and dysdiadochokinesis. When present the intention tremor is mild and the dysarthria is mild to moderately severe. The ataxia has been described to be either non-progressive or slowly progressive. Upper motor neuron (UMN) signs in the legs, manifest by brisk deep tendon reflexes, unsustained ankle clonus, and equivocal or extensor plantar responses, are present in some males. Need for crutches or a wheelchair has been reported. Strabismus is seen in some males. Nystagmus and hypometric saccades may occur. Mild learning disability and depression are seen. The moderate hypochromic and microcytic anemia does not cause symptoms. Carrier (heterozygous) females have a normal neurologic examination and may show mild hematologic abnormalities. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of XLSA/A is suspected in males with characteristic neurologic findings and the presence of moderate hypochromic and microcytic anemia, elevated whole blood total erythrocyte protoporphyrin (TEP) and zinc erythrocyte protoporphyrin (ZnEP), and ring sideroblasts on bone marrow examination. Pappenheimer bodies are seen in peripheral blood smear. The diagnosis is confirmed in a male by identification of a hemizygous pathogenic variant in ABCB7. Females have a normal neurologic examination and may have a dimorphic blood smear with both hypochromic microcytic red blood cells and normal red blood cells; they may have ring sideroblasts on bone marrow examination.

Early in the disease course, children show axial hypotonia followed by dystonia, spasticity, dysarthria, bulbar dysfunction, and signs of parkinsonism including bradykinesia, hypomimia, and tremor. By the end of the first decade, they develop severe, generalized, pharmaco-resistant dystonia, limb contractures, and scoliosis, and lose independent ambulation.

Classic early-onset DTDS: Infants typically manifest nonspecific findings (irritability, feeding difficulties, axial hypotonia, and/or delayed motor development) followed by a hyperkinetic movement disorder (with features of chorea, dystonia, ballismus, orolingual dyskinesia). Over time, affected individuals develop parkinsonism- dystonia characterized by bradykinesia (progressing to akinesia), dystonic posturing, distal tremor, rigidity, and reduced facial expression. Limitation of voluntary movements leads to severe motor delay. Episodic status dystonicus, exacerbations of dystonia, and secondary orthopedic, gastrointestinal, and respiratory complications are common. Many affected individuals appear to show relative preservation of intellect with good cognitive development. Atypical later-onset DTDS: Normal psychomotor development in infancy and early childhood. Attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is reported in childhood followed by later-onset manifestations of parkinsonism-dystonia with tremor, progressive bradykinesia, variable tone, and dystonic posturing. The long- term prognosis of this form of DTDS is currently unknown. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of SLC6A3-related DTDS is established in a proband with characteristic clinical, laboratory, and imaging findings and either biallelic loss-of-function pathogenic variants in SLC6A3 or, rarely, a heterozygous dominant-negative pathogenic variant in SLC6A3 identified by molecular genetic testing.

Management GeneReviews Treatment of manifestations: Treatment to control chorea and dyskinesia in early stages of the disease includes tetrabenazine and benzodiazepines. Dystonia is more difficult to control, and treatment often includes the dopamine agonists pramipexole and ropinirole as first-line agents; adjuncts such as trihexyphenidyl, baclofen, gabapentin, and clonidine for severe dystonia; and chloral hydrate and benzodiazepines for exacerbations of dystonia or status dystonicus. Movement disorders can be exacerbated by pain or discomfort, so diagnosis and treatment of all sources of pain and discomfort (e.g., dental caries, hip dislocation, scoliosis, pressure sores) is essential. Supportive management and developmental support includes: nutrition management and feeding support for oral feeding issues; alternative and augmentative communication devices when needed; medical management of tone issues and regular physical therapy to reduce the risk of contractures and fractures; focal botulinum toxin for contractures; standard treatments for pulmonary infections; influenza vaccine, prophylactic antibiotics, and chest physiotherapy to prevent pulmonary infections; chloral hydrate, melatonin, and other sedatives as needed for sleep issues; anti-serotoninergic agents for vomiting; standard treatments for gastroesophageal reflux, constipation, and ADHD. Surveillance: Every six to 12 months: neurologic assessment; nutrition, swallowing, and speech-language assessment; physiotherapy evaluation for postural and tone issues; evaluation for hip dislocation and spinal deformity; physical and occupational therapy evaluation to assess mobility, activities of daily living, and need for adaptive devices; assessment of the frequency of respiratory infections and presence of sleep issues; assessment for vomiting, gastrointestinal reflux, and constipation; assessment for manifestations of ADHD. Annually: ophthalmology examination for eye movement disorders and refractive errors. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Although the dopamine agonists bromocriptine and pergolide could be considered, the associated increased risk of pulmonary, retroperitoneal, and pericardial fibrosis makes them less desirable than the newer dopamine agonists. Drugs with anti-dopaminergic side effects (e.g., some antihistamines, sedatives, and dimenhydrinate) may exacerbate movement disorders. The antiemetics metoclopramide, prochlorperazine, and other medicines with anti-dopaminergic effects may exacerbate movement disorders. Genetic counseling In most individuals reported to date, SLC6A3-related DTDS is caused by biallelic loss-of-function pathogenic variants and inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Autosomal dominant SLC6A3-related DTDS caused by a heterozygous dominant-negative SLC6A3 pathogenic variant has been reported in one individual to date. Autosomal recessive inheritance: If both parents are known to be heterozygous for an SLC6A3 loss-of-function pathogenic variant, each sib of an affected individual has at conception a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Carrier testing for at-risk relatives requires prior identification of the SLC6A3 pathogenic variants in the family. Autosomal dominant inheritance: Each child of an individual with SLC6A3-related DTDS has a 50% chance of inheriting the dominant-negative SLC6A3 pathogenic variant. Once the SLC6A3 pathogenic variant(s) have been identified in an affected family member, prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing are possible."

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS) is a congenital multiple-anomaly / cognitive impairment syndrome caused by an abnormality in cholesterol metabolism resulting from deficiency of the enzyme 7-dehydrocholesterol (7- DHC) reductase. It is characterized by prenatal and postnatal growth restriction, microcephaly, moderate-to- severe intellectual disability, and multiple major and minor malformations. The malformations include distinctive facial features, cleft palate, cardiac defects, underdeveloped external genitalia in males, postaxial polydactyly, and 2-3 syndactyly of the toes. The clinical spectrum is wide; individuals with normal development and only minor malformations have been described. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of SLOS is established in a proband with suggestive clinical features and elevated 7- dehydrocholesterol level and/or by identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in DHCR7 by molecular genetic testing. Although serum concentration of cholesterol is usually low, it may be in the normal range in approximately 10% of affected individuals, making it an unreliable test for screening and diagnosis. Management Treatment of manifestations: While no long-term dietary studies on cholesterol supplementation have been conducted in a randomized fashion, cholesterol supplementation may result in clinical improvement. Early intervention and physical/occupational/speech therapies are indicated for identified disabilities. Consultation with a nutritionist and consideration of hypoallergenic or elemental formulas in infants; gastrostomy as needed for feeding; neonatal cholestatic liver disease often resolves with cholesterol and/or bile acid therapy. A trial of melatonin or another hypnotic may be considered for those with sleep disturbance. Orthotics, tendon release surgery, or Botox as needed.

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is characterized by muscle weakness and atrophy resulting from progressive degeneration and irreversible loss of the anterior horn cells in the spinal cord (i.e., lower motor neurons) and the brain stem nuclei. The onset of weakness ranges from before birth to adulthood. The weakness is symmetric, proximal greater than distal, and progressive. Before the genetic basis of SMA was understood, it was classified into clinical subtypes based on maximum motor function achieved; however, it is now apparent that the phenotype of SMN1-associated SMA spans a continuum without clear delineation of subtypes. With supportive care only, poor weight gain with growth failure, restrictive lung disease, scoliosis, and joint contractures are common complications; however, newly available targeted treatment options are changing the natural history of the disease. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of SMA is established in a proband with a history of motor difficulties or regression, proximal muscle weakness, reduced/absent deep tendon reflexes, evidence of motor unit disease, and/or biallelic pathogenic variants in SMN1 identified by molecular genetic testing. Increases in SMN2 copy number often modify the phenotype. Management Targeted therapies: Therapies targeted to the underlying disease mechanism include risdiplam (Evrysdi; SMN2- directed RNA splicing modifier), nusinersen (Spinraza; antisense oligonucleotide), and onasemnogene abeparvovec-xioi (Zolgensma; gene replacement therapy) for the treatment of all types of SMA. Treatment with an SMA-specific disease-modifying treatment is most efficacious when initiated presymptomatically. The FDA has issued a black box warning about Zolgensma, noting the possibility of serious liver injury and acute liver failure; close monitoring of liver function prior to and in the months following infusion is indicated.

Copyright 1993-2024, University of Washington, Seattle. GeneReviews is a registered trademark of the University of Washington, Seattle. All rights reserved. GeneReviews targeted treatments may prevent the development or slow the progression of some features of SMA. New phenotypes in treated individuals are arising, and long-term effects of these treatments are unknown. Supportive care: Proactive supportive treatment by a multidisciplinary team is essential to reduce symptom severity, particularly in the most severe cases of SMA and/or in untreated individuals. When nutrition or dysphagia is a concern, placement of a gastrostomy tube early in the course of the disease is appropriate. Standard therapy for gastroesophageal reflux disease and chronic constipation is recommended. Formal consultation and frequent follow up with a pulmonologist familiar with SMA is necessary. As respiratory function deteriorates, tracheotomy or noninvasive respiratory support may be offered. Surgical repair for scoliosis should be considered based on progression of the curvature, pulmonary function, and bone maturity. Surgical intervention for hip dislocation for those with pain may be indicated. Surveillance: Individuals with SMA require monitoring for the development of symptoms to determine appropriate timing to initiate supportive therapies. Surveillance recommendations for potential side effects and new phenotypes associated with the targeted treatments are emerging. Multidisciplinary evaluation every six months or more frequently for weaker children is indicated to assess nutritional state, respiratory function, motor function, and orthopedic status, and to determine appropriate interventions. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Prolonged fasting, particularly in the acutely ill infant with SMA. Evaluation of relatives at risk: It is appropriate to determine the genetic status of younger, apparently asymptomatic sibs of an affected individual in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from prompt initiation of disease-modifying treatments. Pregnancy management: Women with SMA may have an increased rate of preterm birth and need for cesarean section compared to unaffected women. Women with SMA may also experience a persistent worsening of their general muscle weakness after delivery, particularly if disease-modifying therapies are discontinued due to pregnancy status. Due to the risk of respiratory failure, it is recommended that women with neuromuscular disorders, including those with SMA, obtain baseline pulmonary function prior to becoming pregnant, with frequent monitoring during pregnancy. There is limited to no data on the effects of disease-modifying treatments on the developing human fetus. However, based on animal models, risdiplam use should be avoided in pregnant women. Genetic counseling SMA is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Each pregnancy of a couple who have had a child with SMA has an approximately 25% chance of producing an affected child, an approximately 50% chance of producing an asymptomatic carrier, and an approximately 25% chance of producing an unaffected child who is not a carrier. These recurrence risks deviate slightly from the norm for autosomal recessive inheritance because about 2% of affected individuals have a de novo SMN1 pathogenic variant on one allele; in these instances, only one parent is a carrier of an SMN1 variant, and thus the sibs are not at increased risk for SMA. Ideally preconception (but also prenatal) carrier testing for all individuals in the general population and prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk are possible if the diagnosis of SMA has either been confirmed by molecular genetic testing in an affected family member and/or if both parents are found to be carriers of SMA on carrier screening testing.

Infants have feeding difficulties, failure to thrive, hypotonia, hyporeflexia, prolonged napping or need to be awakened for feeds, and generalized lethargy. The majority of individuals function in the mild-to-moderate range of intellectual disability. The behavioral phenotype, including significant sleep disturbance, stereotypies, and maladaptive and self-injurious behaviors, is generally not recognized until age 18 months or older and continues to change until adulthood.

GeneReviews behaviors described, the spasmodic upper-body squeeze or \\\"self-hug\\\" seems to be highly associated with SMS. An underlying developmental asynchrony, specifically emotional maturity delayed beyond intellectual functioning, may also contribute to maladaptive behaviors in people with SMS. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of SMS is established in a proband who has suggestive clinical findings and either a heterozygous deletion at chromosome 17p11.2 that includes RAI1 or a heterozygous intragenic RAI1 pathogenic variant. Management Treatment of manifestations: Early-childhood intervention programs; individualized special education for school-aged children; speech/language, physical, occupational, and behavior therapy and vocational training support later in life. Affected individuals may also benefit from monitored trials of psychotropic medication to increase attention and/or decrease hyperactivity, and therapeutic management of sleep disorders. Standard treatment for epilepsy, obesity, gastroesophageal reflux disease, constipation, hypercholesterolemia, palatal anomalies, scoliosis, ophthalmologic issues, recurrent otitis media, hearing loss, cardiac anomalies, renal anomalies, mild immunodeficiency, hypothyroidism, and growth hormone deficiency. Individuals with a 17p11.2 deletion that includes FLCN may require management of features of Birt-Hogg-Dub syndrome (BHD). Respite care and psychosocial support for family members are recommended. Surveillance: Annual multidisciplinary evaluations for general health and well-being and to plan for educational and vocational or other individualized interventions. In particular, periodic neurodevelopmental assessments and/or consultation with a developmental pediatrician to monitor progress and refer for additional services, evaluations, or support. School-aged children should have periodic comprehensive evaluation to give input to the individualized education program. Annual otolaryngology, audiology, and ophthalmology evaluations. Measurement of growth parameters and nutritional status at each visit. Monitor for the development and/or progression of seizures and scoliosis. Annual fasting lipid profile, screening urinalysis for occult urinary tract infections, and thyroid function tests. Annual family psychosocial assessments are also recommended to assess support for caregivers and sibs. Repeat quantitative immunoglobulins / vaccine titers as clinically indicated. Surveillance for complications of BHD in those with a 17p11.2 deletion that includes FLCN. Agents/circumstances to avoid: When starting a new medication, care should be taken to track sleep and behavior changes over several days or weeks to monitor for potential side effects (e.g., increased appetite, weight gain) and adverse reactions and/or to determine potential efficacy. Genetic counseling SMS is caused by a heterozygous deletion of or a heterozygous pathogenic variant in RAI1 on chromosome 17p11.2. The majority of 17p11.2 deletions are de novo, while deleterious variants in RAI1 can be de novo or inherited. Complex familial chromosome rearrangements leading to del(17)(p11.2) and SMS occur but are rare. Although SMS usually occurs as the result of a de novo deletion of 17p11.2, rare instances of vertical transmission from an affected parent to a child, parental germline mosaicism, and complex familial chromosome rearrangements leading to del(17)(p11.2) and SMS have been reported. If the SMS-related genetic alteration has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible. In the rare instance of a complex familial chromosome rearrangement, prenatal testing is possible for a pregnancy at increased risk using prenatal chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) and sequencing on fetal cells.

Developmental delay usually presents as failure to meet early developmental milestones and then evolves to moderate to profound intellectual disability (which appears to remain stable over time) and variable motor disability. Asthenic habitus and low muscle mass usually develop during the first year, even in males who are ambulatory. During the first decade, males with SRS develop osteoporosis, resulting in fractures in the absence of trauma.

The major clinical features of SOST-related sclerosteosis are progressive skeletal overgrowth, most pronounced in the skull and mandible, and variable syndactyly, usually of the second (index) and third (middle) fingers. Affected individuals appear normal at birth except for syndactyly. Facial distortion due to frontal bossing and mandibular overgrowth is seen in nearly all individuals and becomes apparent in early childhood with progression into adulthood. Hyperostosis of the skull results in narrowing of the foramina, causing entrapment of the seventh cranial nerve (leading to facial palsy) with other, less common nerve entrapment syndromes including visual loss (2nd cranial nerve), neuralgia or anosmia (5th cranial nerve), and sensorineural hearing loss (8th cranial nerve). In SOST-related sclerosteosis, hyperostosis of the calvarium reduces intracranial volume, increasing the risk for potentially lethal elevation of intracranial pressure. Survival of individuals with SOST- related sclerosteosis into old age is unusual but not unprecedented. The manifestations of van Buchem disease are generally milder than SOST-related sclerosteosis. Stature is typically normal, cranial nerve entrapment of the seventh and eighth cranial nerves are common, and increased intracranial pressure is rare, seen only in severely affected individuals. Individuals with van Buchem disease do not have syndactyly or other digit deformities. Life span appears not to be altered.

Compared to other forms of autosomal dominant hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP), in which diminished vibration sense (caused by degeneration of the corticospinal tracts and dorsal columns) and urinary bladder hyperactivity are present in all affected individuals, these findings occur in a minority of individuals with SPG3A. The average age of onset is four years. More than 80% of reported individuals manifest spastic gait before the end of the first decade of life. Most persons with early-onset ATL1-HSP have a \\\"pure\\\" (\\\"uncomplicated\\\") HSP; however, complicated HSP with axonal motor neuropathy and/or distal amyotrophy with lower motor neuron involvement (Silver syndrome phenotype) has been observed.

Medical treatment of spasticity may begin with oral baclofen or tizanidine, followed by chemodenervation with botulinum A or B toxins if oral antispasticity medications are not tolerated. Intrathecal baclofen pump may be considered for those who improve on oral baclofen but have significant systemic adverse effects. Medical therapy should be combined with intensive physical therapy focused on stretching and strengthening exercises that may help delay or minimize muscle tendon contractures, scoliosis, and foot deformities.

Other common features include parkinsonian signs (tremor, bradykinesia, masked facies, rigidity), limb hypertonia, hyperreflexia, intellectual disability, psychiatric and/or behavioral abnormalities, autonomic dysfunction, and sleep disturbances (hypersomnolence, difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, and drowsiness). Most affected individuals have nonspecific features in infancy including developmental delays and axial hypotonia; other features develop over time.

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (SSADH) deficiency is characterized by infantile-onset hypotonia, developmental delay, cognitive impairment, expressive language deficit, and mild ataxia. Epilepsy is present in about half of affected individuals and is more common in adults. Hyperkinetic behavior, aggression, self- injurious behaviors, hallucinations, and sleep disturbances have been reported in nearly half of all affected individuals, more commonly in those who are older. Basal ganglia signs including choreoathetosis, dystonia, and myoclonus have been reported in a few individuals with earlier-onset, more severe disease. Involvement beyond the central nervous system has not been described. Individuals with SSADH deficiency typically have 4-hydroxybutyric aciduria present on urine organic acid analysis. Head MRI reveals T2 hyperintensities in multiple regions, involving the globus pallidi, cerebellar dentate nuclei, subthalamic nuclei, subcortical white matter, and brain stem, as well as cerebral and sometimes cerebellar atrophy. EEG findings include background slowing and spike discharges that are usually generalized. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of SSADH deficiency is established by the identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in ALDH5A1.

While vigabatrin is an irreversible inhibitor of GABA-transaminase and thus inhibits the formation of succinic semialdehyde, it has shown inconsistent results in treatment of seizures associated with SSADH deficiency. Methylphenidate, thioridazine, risperidal, fluoxetine, and benzodiazepines have been used for treatment of increased anxiety, aggressiveness, and inattention. Additional, non-pharmacologic treatments may include physical and occupational therapy, sensory integration, feeding and/or speech therapy.

The hearing loss is mild to moderate, congenital, bilateral, and symmetric. Mean pure tone hearing loss averages 40-50 decibels (dB) at the time of diagnosis; hearing loss is not severe to profound in children or young adults. Of note, while many newborns with STRC-HL will be identified by newborn hearing screening (NBHS), some newborns with STRC-HL will not because some screening methods may not detect milder hearing loss. Males with biallelic contiguous gene deletions involving STRC and CATSPER2 are at risk for CATSPER2-related male infertility due to morphologic sperm abnormalities that affect sperm motility. In contrast, females with contiguous gene deletions do not have related fertility issues. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of STRC-HL is established in a proband with suggestive findings who has ONE of the following identified by molecular genetic testing: (1) biallelic STRC pathogenic variants; (2) one STRC pathogenic variant and one contiguous gene deletion involving STRC and CATSPER2; or (3) biallelic contiguous gene deletions involving STRC and CATSPER2. Management Treatment of manifestations: Multidisciplinary supportive treatment for hearing loss that includes an otolaryngologist with expertise in the management of early childhood otologic disorders, an audiologist experienced in the assessment of hearing loss in children, a speech-language pathologist, a clinical geneticist, a genetic counselor, and a pediatrician is recommended.

When males with biallelic contiguous gene deletions involving STRC and CATSPER2 reach reproductive age, consultation with a reproductive specialist/endocrinologist for consideration of fertility-related evaluations is appropriate. Surveillance: To monitor the degree of hearing loss, the individual's response to use of hearing aids, and development of speech and language, the following are recommended: (1) annual examination by an otolaryngologist familiar with genetic hearing loss to evaluate overall ear health; (2) repeat audiometry to identify any change in hearing, typically (a) every three months between birth and age two years, (b) every six months between ages two and five years, and (c) annually in children age five years and older if hearing is stable and there are no other otologic concerns; and (3) evaluation of speech/language/communication needs as recommended by a speech-language pathologist. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Prolonged noise exposure exceeding 85 dB, including loud noise exposure from headphones and earbuds. Note that a headphone safety feature built into most smartphones can be set to limit the noise level. Evaluation of relatives at risk: It is appropriate to clarify the genetic status of sibs of a proband with STRC-HL; early identification of infants and children with hearing loss allows appropriate support and management to be provided to the child and family. Genetic counseling STRC-HL is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. The parents of an individual with STRC-HL are typically heterozygous for a genetic alteration involving STRC (i.e., a STRC pathogenic variant or a contiguous gene deletion involving STRC and CATSPER2). If both parents are known to be heterozygous for a genetic alteration involving STRC, each sib of the proband has at conception a 25% chance of having STRC-HL, a 50% chance of being a carrier and not having STRC-HL, and a 25% chance of not being a carrier and not having STRC-HL. Males with biallelic contiguous gene deletions involving STRC and CATSPER2 are at risk of decreased fertility due to abnormal sperm motility; thus, when they reach reproductive age they may benefit from fertility counseling and discussion of assistive reproductive technology options.

On occasion, the abnormal hematologic findings may be the initial presentation or the only clinical feature of this disorder. Arthritis, arthralgias, and splenomegaly may sometimes be seen and one study has concluded that \\\"idiopathic\\\" liver disease could be undiagnosed sitosterolemia. The clinical spectrum of sitosterolemia is probably not fully appreciated due to underdiagnosis and the fact that the phenotype in infants is likely to be highly dependent on diet. Diagnosis/testing In an individual with sitosterolemia, increased plasma concentrations of plant sterols (especially sitosterol, campesterol, and stigmasterol) are observed if the diet includes plant-derived food, which contain plant sterols once the plant sterols have accumulated in the body.

GeneReviews with greatly increased plant sterol concentrations in plasma and/or by identification of biallelic pathogenic (or likely pathogenic) variants in ABCG5 and/or ABCG8. Management Treatment of manifestations: Treatment should begin at the time of diagnosis, though there is little experience treating children younger than age two years. Treatment can decrease plasma concentrations of cholesterol and sitosterol by 10% to 50%. Often existing xanthomas regress. Treatment recommendations include a diet low in shellfish sterols and plant sterols (vegetable oils, margarine, nuts, seeds, avocados, and chocolate) and use of the sterol absorption inhibitor, ezetimibe. In those with an incomplete response to ezetimibe, use of a bile acid sequestrant such as cholestryramine may be considered. Partial ileal bypass surgery may be considered as a last resort for those with poor response to maximal therapies. If arthritis, arthralgias, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and/or splenomegaly require treatment, the first step is management of the sitosterolemia, followed by routine symptomatic management. Surveillance: Begin monitoring at the time of diagnosis on an annual basis: plasma concentrations of plant sterols (primarily beta-sitosterol and campesterol) and cholesterol; the size, number, and distribution of xanthomas; and CBC and platelet count, and liver transaminases (for elevation). In persons with long-standing untreated sitosterolemia, noninvasive imaging is used to exclude coronary and carotid plaque as well as valvular atherosclerotic manifestations. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Margarines and other products containing stanols (e.g., campestanol and sitostanol) that are recommended for use by persons with hypercholesterolemia are contraindicated as they can exacerbate plant stanol accumulation. Evaluation of relatives at risk: Early diagnosis of at-risk relatives either through measurement of plasma concentrations of plant sterols or through molecular genetic testing (if the family-specific pathogenic variants are known) allows early institution of treatment and surveillance to optimize outcome. Pregnancy management: There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of ezetimibe in pregnant women; ezetimibe can be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefits justifiy the risk to the fetus. Since no studies have been published on the fetal effects of ezetimibe, it should be used with caution during pregnancy. Genetic counseling Sitosterolemia is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. At conception, each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Heterozygotes (carriers) are asymptomatic but may occasionally have a mildly elevated concentration of sitosterol.

To date more than 50 individuals with SYNGAP1- ID have been reported. In the majority DD/ID was moderate to severe; in some it was mild. The epilepsy is generalized; a subset of individuals with epilepsy have myoclonic astatic epilepsy (Doose syndrome) or epilepsy with myoclonic absences. Behavioral abnormalities can include stereotypic behaviors (e.g., hand flapping, obsessions with certain objects) as well as poor social development. Feeding difficulties can be significant in some. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of SYNGAP1-ID is established in a proband with developmental delay or intellectual disability in whom molecular genetic testing identifies either a heterozygous pathogenic variant in SYNGAP1 (~89%) or a deletion of 6p21.3 (~11%). Management Treatment of manifestations: DD/ID are managed as per standard practice. No guidelines are available regarding choice of specific anti-seizure medications (ASMs). In about 50% of patients, the epilepsy responds to a single ASM; in the remainder it is pharmacoresistant. Children may qualify for and benefit from interventions used in treatment of ASD. Consultation with a developmental pediatrician may guide parents through appropriate behavioral management strategies and/or provide prescription medications when necessary. Nasogastric/ gastrostomy feeding may be required for individuals with persistent feeding issues. Surveillance: Monitor seizure manifestations and control; behavioral issues; developmental progress and educational needs.

Genetic counseling GeneReviews SYNGAP1-ID is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. To date almost all probands with SYNGAP1-ID whose parents have undergone molecular genetic testing have had a de novo germline pathogenic variant; however, vertical transmission (from a mildly affected, mosaic parent to the proband) has been reported in one family. Thus, while the risk to sibs appears to be low, it is presumed to be greater than in the general population because of the possibility of germline mosaicism in a parent.

It can present at birth or in infancy with severe pain with movement, progressive joint contractures, and often with severe motor disability, thickened skin, and hyperpigmented macules/patches over bony prominences of the joints. Gingival hypertrophy, skin nodules, pearly papules of the face and neck, and perianal masses are common. Complications of protein-losing enteropathy and failure to thrive can be life threatening. Cognitive development is normal. Many children with the severe form (previously called infantile systemic hyalinosis) have a significant risk of morbidity or mortality in early childhood; some with a milder phenotype (previously called juvenile hyaline fibromatosis) survive into adulthood. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of HFS is established in a proband with characteristic clinical features and/or biallelic pathogenic (or likely pathogenic) variants in ANTXR2 identified by molecular genetic testing. Skin biopsy may reveal hyaline material accumulation in the dermis or nondiagnostic findings; intestinal biopsy may demonstrate villous atrophy and lymphangiectasia. Skeletal x-rays may reveal osteopenia, periosteal reaction, and lucent lesions. Management Treatment of manifestations: Possible nasogastric tube, gastrostomy tube feeding, or parenteral nutrition under supervision of a gastroenterologist and nutritionist; nutrition tailored for the possibility of malabsorption or lymphangiectasia; hydration and albumin infusions for protein-losing enteropathy; physiotherapy for joint contractures can be considered although pain may be problematic; nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, opiates, and possibly gabapentin for pain; gentle handling; splinting may reduce pain; consultation with a pain Author Affiliations: 1 Division of Medical Genetics, Department of Pediatrics, Institute for Human Genetics, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California; Email: joseph.shieh2@ucsf.edu. 2 Department of Pediatrics, Sanford School of Medicine, University of South Dakota; Sanford Children's Hospital, Sioux Falls, South Dakota. 3 Department of Medical Genetics, Island Medical Program, University of British Columbia, Victoria, British Columbia, Canada.

The major clinical signs of Tangier disease include hyperplastic yellow-orange tonsils, hepatosplenomegaly, and peripheral neuropathy, which may be either relapsing-remitting or chronic progressive in nature. Rarer complications may include corneal opacities that typically do not affect vision, premature atherosclerotic coronary artery disease occurring in the sixth and seventh decades of life (not usually before age 40 years), and mild hematologic manifestations, such as mild thrombocytopenia, reticulocytosis, stomatocytosis, or hemolytic anemia. The clinical expression of Tangier disease is variable, with some affected individuals only showing biochemical perturbations. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of Tangier disease is established in a proband with absent or extremely low HDL-cholesterol and apo A-I levels and biallelic pathogenic variants in ABCA1 identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Tonsillectomy in those with airway obstruction or mass symptoms; transient bracing (such as ankle-foot orthosis) and exercise for those with peripheral neuropathy; corneal transplantation for corneal opacities that interfere with daily living; standard treatment for hepatosplenomegaly, coronary artery disease, severe thrombocytopenia, and severe hemolytic anemia.

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Thrombocytopenia absent radius (TAR) syndrome is characterized by bilateral absence of the radii with the presence of both thumbs, and thrombocytopenia that is generally transient. Thrombocytopenia may be congenital or may develop within the first few weeks to months of life; in general, thrombocytopenic episodes decrease with age. Cow's milk allergy is common and can be associated with exacerbation of thrombocytopenia. Other anomalies of the skeleton (upper and lower limbs, ribs, and vertebrae), heart, and genitourinary system (renal anomalies and agenesis of uterus, cervix, and upper part of the vagina) can occur. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of TAR syndrome is established in a proband with bilateral absent radii, present thumbs, and thrombocytopenia. Identification of a heterozygous null allele (most often a minimally deleted 200-kb region at chromosome band 1q21.1) in trans with a heterozygous RBM8A hypomorphic allele on molecular genetic testing confirms the diagnosis. Management Treatment of manifestations: Orthopedic intervention as needed to maximize limb function. Platelet transfusion for thrombocytopenia as needed; to reduce the risks of alloimmunization and infection, avoid platelet transfusion in older individuals whose platelet counts exceed a particular threshold (10 platelets/nL). Standard treatments for cardiac and genitourinary anomalies. Avoidance of cow's milk to reduce the severity of gastroenteritis and to avoid exacerbations of thrombocytopenia. Central venous catheter as an alternative to repeated venipuncture. Surveillance: Platelet count when evidence of increased bleeding tendency (bruising, petechiae) occurs. Assess for gastrointestinal manifestations in children, which may indicate cow's milk allergy, at each visit.

GeneReviews Agents/circumstances to avoid: Avoid cow's milk to reduce the severity of gastroenteritis and associated thrombocytopenia (in older children). Platelet function is somewhat impaired, suggesting that drugs such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or aspirin should be avoided or used with caution. Genetic counseling TAR syndrome is caused by compound heterozygosity for a null allele and an RBM8A hypomorphic allele and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. However, because null alleles are rare (and often occur de novo in the proband) and RBM8A hypomorphic alleles are common, inheritance of TAR syndrome is associated with several features unusual in autosomal recessive disorders: a paucity of affected sibs, apparent parent-to-child transmission, and affected second- and third-degree relatives. The risk to sibs of a proband varies depending on the genetic status of the parents; for example: If one parent is known to be heterozygous for a null allele and the other parent is heterozygous for an RBM8A hypomorphic allele, each sib of an affected individual has at conception a 25% chance of being affected. If one parent is known to be heterozygous for a null allele and the other parent has biallelic RBM8A hypomorphic alleles, each sib of an affected individual has at conception a 50% chance of being affected. If one parent is known to be heterozygous for an RBM8A hypomorphic allele and the other parent has two normal RBM8A alleles, each sib of an affected individual has at conception a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier of an RBM8A hypomorphic allele and a 50% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Individuals who are heterozygotes (carriers) for one TAR syndrome-related pathogenic variant (either an RBM8A hypomorphic allele or a null allele) are asymptomatic; individuals with biallelic RBM8A hypomorphic alleles are asymptomatic. Once the causative null allele and RBM8A hypomorphic allele have been identified in an affected family member, carrier testing for at-risk relatives as well as prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing are possible."

The phenotypic spectrum encompasses pure (i.e., without other neurologic findings) amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS; most common), pure (i.e., without other neurologic findings) frontotemporal dementia (FTD; rare), a combination of ALS and FTD, and atypical neurologic phenotypes (very rare). Individuals with the same TARDBP pathogenic variant (even within the same family) may have clinical features that vary in both type and severity. Common manifestations are dysarthria and dysphagia; less common manifestations can include parkinsonism, cognitive deterioration, and behavioral and psychological manifestations of dementia. Life expectancy for TARDBP-ALS is highly variable and mainly associated with an individual's clinical features; overall disease duration averages three to five years. For TARDBP-FTD, disease duration averages one to 16 years. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of TARDBP-ALS-FTD is established in a proband with suggestive findings and most commonly a heterozygous pathogenic (or likely pathogenic) variant in TARDBP identified by molecular genetic testing. Rarely, homozygous pathogenic (or likely pathogenic) variants in TARDBP have been reported. Management Treatment of manifestations: There is no cure for TARDBP-ALS-FTD.

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics HEXA disorders are best considered as a disease continuum based on the amount of residual beta- hexosaminidase A (HEX A) enzyme activity. This, in turn, depends on the molecular characteristics and biological impact of the HEXA pathogenic variants. HEX A is necessary for degradation of GM2 ganglioside; without well-functioning enzymes, GM2 ganglioside builds up in the lysosomes of brain and nerve cells. The classic clinical phenotype is known as Tay-Sachs disease (TSD), characterized by progressive weakness, loss of motor skills beginning between ages three and six months, decreased visual attentiveness, and increased or exaggerated startle response with a cherry-red spot observable on the retina followed by developmental plateau and loss of skills after eight to ten months. Seizures are common by 12 months with further deterioration in the second year of life and death occurring between ages two and three years with some survival to five to seven years. Subacute juvenile TSD is associated with normal developmental milestones until age two years, when the emergence of abnormal gait or dysarthria is noted followed by loss of previously acquired skills and cognitive decline. Spasticity, dysphagia, and seizures are present by the end of the first decade of life, with death within the second decade of life, usually by aspiration. Late-onset TSD presents in older teens or young adults with a slowly progressive spectrum of neurologic symptoms including lower-extremity weakness with muscle atrophy, dysarthria, incoordination, tremor, mild spasticity and/or dystonia, and psychiatric manifestations including acute psychosis. Clinical variability even among affected members of the same family is observed in both the subacute juvenile and the late-onset TSD phenotypes.

Diagnosis/testing GeneReviews The diagnosis of a HEXA disorder is established in a proband with abnormally low HEX A activity on enzyme testing and biallelic pathogenic variants in HEXA identified by molecular genetic testing. Targeted analysis for certain pathogenic variants can be performed first in individuals of specific ethnicity (e.g., French Canadian, Ashkenazi Jewish). Enzyme testing of affected individuals identifies absent to near-absent HEX A enzymatic activity in the serum, white blood cells, or other tissues in the presence of normal or elevated activity of the beta- hexosaminidase B enzyme. Pseudodeficiency refers to an in vitro phenomenon caused by specific HEXA variants that renders the enzyme unable to process the synthetic (but not the natural) GM2 substrates, and leads to false positive enzyme testing results. Management Treatment of manifestations: Treatment is mostly supportive and directed to providing adequate nutrition and hydration, managing infectious disease, protecting the airway, and controlling seizures. The treatment for the subacute juvenile and late-onset Tay-Sachs phenotypes is directed to providing the services of a physiatrist and team of physical, occupational, and speech therapists for maximizing function and providing aids for activities of daily living. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Positioning that increases aspiration risk during feedings and seizure medication dosages that result in excessive sedation for those with acute infantile TSD; situations that increase the likelihood of contractures or pressure sores, such as extended periods of immobility; circumstances that exacerbate the risk of falls (i.e., walking on uneven or unstable surfaces) in those with subacute juvenile TSD; psychiatric medications that have been associated with disease worsening, including haloperidol, risperidone, and chlorpromazine. Genetic counseling Acute infantile Tay-Sachs disease (TSD), subacute juvenile TSD, and late-onset TSD (comprising the clinical spectrum of HEXA disorders) are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. At conception, each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Heterozygotes (carriers) are asymptomatic. Once both HEXA pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member, targeted analysis for the specific familial variants can be used for carrier testing in at-risk relatives. Molecular genetic testing and/or HEX A enzyme testing can be used for carrier detection in individuals who do not have a family history of TSD. If both members of a reproductive couple are known to be heterozygous for a HEXA pathogenic variant, molecular genetic prenatal testing and preimplantation genetic testing for the HEXA pathogenic variants identified in the parents are possible."

Impaired kidney function, including end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), may occur with or without structural abnormalities (mild malrotation, ectopia, horseshoe kidney, renal hypoplasia, polycystic kidneys, vesicoureteral reflux). Foot malformations (flat feet, overlapping toes) and genitourinary malformations are common. Congenital heart disease occurs in 15% of affected individuals. Developmental delay and/or learning difficulties occur in approximately 15% of affected individuals. Rare features include growth deficiency, Duane anomaly, iris coloboma, and Chiari I malformation. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of SALL1-TBS is established in a proband with characteristic clinical findings and a heterozygous pathogenic variant in SALL1 identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Immediate surgical intervention for imperforate anus; stool softeners, prokinetics, osmotic agents, or laxatives as needed for constipation; standard treatment of gastroesophageal reflux; early treatment of hearing loss; surgery for severe malformations of the hands; hemodialysis and possibly kidney transplantation for ESKD; management of genitourinary anomalies per urologist or gynecologist; surgery or medical treatment by cardiologist for congenital heart defects; developmental and educational support as needed; neuropsychiatric management as needed for behavioral issues; growth hormone therapy for those with growth hormone deficiency; management of ocular issues per ophthalmologist.

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Treacher Collins syndrome (TCS) is characterized by lower eyelid abnormalities, malar hypoplasia, downslanted palpebral fissures, and micro- or retrognathia due to symmetric hypoplasia of the zygomatic bones, maxilla, and mandible. External ear anomalies include absent, small, malformed, and/or posteriorly rotated ears and atresia or stenosis of the external auditory canals. About 40%-50% of individuals have conductive hearing loss attributed most commonly to malformation of the ossicles and hypoplasia of the middle ear cavities. Inner ear structures tend to be normal. Significant respiratory and feeding difficulties can be present in infancy. Other, less common abnormalities include cleft palate and unilateral or bilateral choanal stenosis or atresia. Typically, intellect is normal. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of TCS is established in a proband with characteristic clinical features and/or a heterozygous pathogenic variant in TCOF1, POLR1D, or POLR1B, biallelic pathogenic variants in POLR1C, or, rarely, biallelic pathogenic variants in POLR1D identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Treatment should be tailored to the specific needs of each individual, preferably by a multidisciplinary craniofacial management team. Neonates with airway issues may require airway management at delivery, special positioning, or tracheostomy to facilitate ventilation. Tube feeding may be needed for adequate caloric intake. Cleft palate repair (if needed) occurs at about age one year. Hearing loss is treated with bone conduction amplification, speech therapy, and educational intervention. Management of ocular issues is per ophthalmologist. Standard management for cardiac, gastrointestinal, renal, and limb anomalies.

Surveillance: Annual ophthalmology and audiology evaluations; assess for manifestations of obstructive sleep apnea, growth, and caloric intake at each visit; dental exams every six months with orthodontia exams as needed; assess speech development and educational progress annually or as needed. Genetic counseling TCS can be inherited in an autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive manner. Autosomal dominant inheritance accounts for most of TCS, most commonly heterozygous pathogenic variants in TCOF1 and less commonly heterozygous pathogenic variants in POLR1B or POLR1D. Autosomal recessive inheritance (biallelic pathogenic variants in POLR1C or POLR1D) accounts for a minority of TCS. Significant intrafamilial clinical variability is common. Autosomal dominant TCS: About 55%-61% of individuals with autosomal dominant TCS have the disorder as the result of a de novo pathogenic variant. Each child of an individual with autosomal dominant TCS has a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant. Autosomal recessive TCS: The parents of a child with autosomal recessive TCS are presumed to be heterozygous for a POLR1C or POLR1D pathogenic variant. If both parents are known to be heterozygous for a TCS-causing pathogenic variant, each sib of an individual with autosomal recessive TCS has at conception a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Carrier testing for at-risk relatives requires prior identification of the TCS-related pathogenic variants in the family. Once the TCS-related pathogenic variant(s) have been identified in an affected family member, prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing are possible."

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Thanatophoric dysplasia (TD) is a short-limb skeletal dysplasia that is usually lethal in the perinatal period. TD is divided into subtypes: TD type 1 is characterized by micromelia with bowed femurs and, uncommonly, the presence of craniosynostosis of varying severity. TD type 2 is characterized by micromelia with straight femurs and uniform presence of moderate-to- severe craniosynostosis with cloverleaf skull deformity. Other features common to type 1 and type 2 include: short ribs, narrow thorax, relative macrocephaly, distinctive facial features, brachydactyly, hypotonia, and redundant skin folds along the limbs. Most affected infants die of respiratory insufficiency shortly after birth. Rare long-term survivors have been reported. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of TD is established in a proband with characteristic clinical and/or radiologic features and/or a heterozygous pathogenic variant in FGFR3 identified on molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Most individuals with TD die in the perinatal period because of the multisystem complications of the disorder. Management goals should be established with the family and may focus on provision of comfort care. Newborns require long-term respiratory support (typically with tracheostomy and ventilation) to survive. Anesthetic management guidelines for skeletal dysplasias are applicable to individuals with TD. Other treatment measures may include shunt placement for hydrocephalus, suboccipital decompression for relief of craniocervical junction constriction, anti-seizure medication to control seizures, and hearing aids.

GeneReviews Surveillance: Long-term survivors need neuroimaging to monitor for craniocervical constriction, assessment of neurologic status, and EEG to monitor for seizure activity, as well as developmental, orthopedic, and audiology evaluations. Pregnancy management: When TD is diagnosed prenatally, treatment goals are to avoid potential pregnancy complications including prematurity, polyhydramnios, malpresentation, and delivery complications from macrocephaly and/or a flexed and rigid neck; cephalocentesis and cesarean section may be considered to avoid maternal complications. Genetic counseling TD is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner; the majority of probands have a de novo FGFR3 pathogenic variant. Risk of sib recurrence for parents who have had one affected child is not significantly increased over that of the general population. Germline mosaicism in healthy parents, although not reported to date, remains a theoretic possibility. Prenatal diagnosis is possible by ultrasound examination and molecular genetic testing."

Amyloidosis can involve the heart, central nervous system (CNS), eyes, and kidneys. The disease usually begins in the third to fifth decade in persons from endemic foci in Portugal and Japan; onset is later in persons from other areas. Typically, sensory neuropathy starts in the lower extremities with paresthesia and hypesthesia of the feet, followed within a few years by motor neuropathy. In some persons, particularly those with early-onset disease, autonomic neuropathy is the first manifestation of the condition; findings can include orthostatic hypotension, constipation alternating with diarrhea, attacks of nausea and vomiting, delayed gastric emptying, sexual impotence, anhidrosis, and urinary retention or incontinence. Cardiac amyloidosis is mainly characterized by progressive restrictive cardiomyopathy. Individuals with leptomeningeal amyloidosis may have the following CNS findings: dementia, psychosis, visual impairment, headache, seizures, motor paresis, ataxia, myelopathy, hydrocephalus, or intracranial hemorrhage. Ocular involvement includes vitreous opacity, glaucoma, dry eye, and ocular amyloid angiopathy. Mild-to-severe kidney disease can develop. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of ATTRv amyloidosis is established in a proband with characteristic clinical features, including imaging or histopathology findings of amyloidosis, and a heterozygous pathogenic variant in TTR identified by molecular genetic testing.

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) deficiency is associated with a broad phenotypic spectrum. Based on severity of symptoms/signs as well as responsiveness to levodopa therapy, clinical phenotypes caused by pathogenic variants in TH are divided into (1) TH-deficient dopa-responsive dystonia (the mild form of TH deficiency), (2) TH-deficient infantile parkinsonism with motor delay (the severe form), and (3) TH-deficient progressive infantile encephalopathy (the very severe form). In individuals with TH-deficient dopa-responsive dystonia (DYT5b, DYT-TH), onset is between age 12 months and 12 years; initial symptoms are typically lower-limb dystonia and/or difficulty in walking. Diurnal fluctuation of symptoms (worsening of the symptoms toward the evening and their alleviation in the morning after sleep) may be present. In most individuals with TH-deficient infantile parkinsonism with motor delay, onset is between age three and 12 months. In contrast to TH-deficient DRD, motor milestones are overtly delayed in this severe form. Affected infants demonstrate truncal hypotonia and parkinsonian symptoms and signs (hypokinesia, rigidity of extremities, and/or tremor). In individuals with TH-deficient progressive infantile encephalopathy, onset is before age three to six months. Fetal distress is reported in most. Affected individuals have marked delay in motor development, truncal hypotonia, severe hypokinesia, limb hypertonia (rigidity and/or spasticity), hyperreflexia, oculogyric crises, ptosis, intellectual disability, and paroxysmal periods of lethargy (with increased sweating and drooling) alternating with irritability.

Management Treatment of manifestations: GeneReviews All individuals with TH-deficient DRD demonstrate complete responsiveness of symptoms to levodopa (with a decarboxylase inhibitor). Individuals with TH-deficient infantile parkinsonism with motor delay demonstrate a marked response to levodopa. However, in contrast to TH-deficient DRD, the responsiveness is generally not complete and/or it takes several months or even years before the full effects of treatment become established. Some individuals are hypersensitive to levodopa and prone to side effects (i.e., dopa-induced dyskinesias which develop at initiation of levodopa treatment). Individuals with TH-deficient progressive infantile encephalopathy are extremely sensitive to levodopa therapy. In this very severe form, treatment with levodopa is often limited by intolerable dyskinesias. Prevention of primary manifestations: Levodopa therapy from early infancy may prevent manifestations of some symptoms and signs in TH-deficient infantile parkinsonism with motor delay; however, no levodopa trials in the early postnatal period of infants with this type of TH deficiency and biallelic TH pathogenic variants have been reported. Prevention of secondary complications: Side effects associated with levodopa (e.g., gastroesophageal reflux, vomiting, significant suppression of appetite) may be ameliorated with dose adjustment and supportive intervention. Surveillance: Examination by a movement disorder specialist in pediatric or adult neurology at least several times yearly. Agents/circumstances to avoid: The prokinetic agent Reglan and other related antidopaminergic agents.

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics The first identified CACNA1C-related disorder, referred to as Timothy syndrome, consists of the combination of prolonged QT interval, autism, and cardiovascular malformation with syndactyly of the fingers and toes. Infrequent findings also include developmental and speech delay, seizures, and recurrent infections. With increased availability of molecular genetic testing, a wider spectrum of pathogenic variants and clinical findings associated with CACNA1C-related disorders has been recognized. Because CACNA1C is associated with calcium channel function, all individuals with a pathogenic variant in this gene are at risk for cardiac arrhythmia of a specific type. The clinical manifestations of a CACNA1C-related disorder include three phenotypes: Timothy syndrome with or without syndactyly QT prolongation (QTc >480 ms) and arrhythmias in the absence of other syndromic features Short QT syndrome (QTc <350 ms) or Brugada syndrome with short QT interval These three phenotypes can be separated into two broad categories on the basis of the functional consequences of the pathogenic variants in CACNA1C: QT prolongation with or without a Timothy syndrome-associated phenotype associated with pathogenic variants inducing a gain of function at the cellular level (i.e., increased calcium current) Short QT interval with or without Brugada syndrome EKG pattern associated with pathogenic variants causing loss of function (i.e., reduced calcium current) Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of a CACNA1C-related disorder is established in a proband with suggestive findings and a heterozygous pathogenic variant in CACNA1C identified by molecular genetic testing.

Management GeneReviews Treatment of manifestations: Treatment includes use of beta blockers and/or other antiarrhythmic drugs to maintain QT interval stability to prevent ventricular tachyarrhythmia. In some instances, pacemakers can be placed during the first days of life to control 2:1 atrioventricular block and resultant bradycardia, but an implantable cardioverter defibrillator to prevent sudden cardiac death should be considered in all affected persons. Standard care is recommended for cardiovascular malformations and extracardiac malformations such as syndactyly and hypoglycemia. Prevention of primary manifestations: Arrhythmias must be prevented with the standard therapy. Because anesthesia is a known trigger for cardiac arrhythmia, close cardiac monitoring is warranted during surgery. Fever can be a trigger for arrhythmias in individuals with CACNA1C-related Brugada syndrome and requires aggressive treatment with standard antipyretic drugs. Surveillance: Cardiac and neurologic evaluations every six to 12 months. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Drugs reported to prolong QT interval; drugs and dietary practices that could lead to hypoglycemia. Evaluation of relatives at risk: It is appropriate to clarify the genetic status of the older and younger at-risk relatives of a proband in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from a complete cardiac evaluation and institution of measures to prevent cardiac arrhythmias. Genetic counseling CACNA1C-related disorders are autosomal dominant disorders. Many individuals diagnosed with a CACNA1C- related disorder particularly those individuals with Timothy syndrome represent simplex cases (i.e., a single affected family member) and have the disorder as the result of a pathogenic variant that occurred de novo in the proband or in a mosaic parent. If a parent of the proband is affected and/or is known to be heterozygous for the pathogenic variant identified in the proband, the risk to the sibs of inheriting the pathogenic variant is 50%. If the proband has a known CACNA1C pathogenic variant that cannot be detected in the leukocyte DNA of either parent, the recurrence risk to sibs is greater than that of the general population because of the possibility of parental germline mosaicism. Once the CACNA1C pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing and preimplantation genetic testing for a pregnancy at increased risk for a CACNA1C- related disorder are possible."

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics TK2-related mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) maintenance defect is a phenotypic continuum that ranges from severe to mild. To date, approximately 107 individuals with a molecularly confirmed diagnosis have been reported. Three main subtypes of presentation have been described: Infantile-onset myopathy with neurologic involvement and rapid progression to early death. Affected individuals experience progressive muscle weakness leading to respiratory failure. Some individuals develop dysarthria, dysphagia, and/or hearing loss. Cognitive function is typically spared. Juvenile/childhood onset with generalized proximal weakness and survival to at least 13 years Late-/adult-onset myopathy with facial and limb weakness and mtDNA deletions. Some affected individuals develop respiratory insufficiency, chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia, dysphagia, and dysarthria. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of TK2-related mtDNA maintenance defect is established in a proband with infantile onset of disease with severely reduced (typically <20% of age- and tissue-matched healthy controls) mtDNA content in skeletal muscle. The diagnosis of TK2-related mtDNA maintenance defect is established in a proband older than age two years with reduced mtDNA content or multiple mtDNA deletions, ragged red fibers and/or COX- deficient fibers in skeletal muscle. The diagnosis is confirmed by the identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in TK2 by molecular genetic testing.

Management GeneReviews Treatment of manifestations: Management should involve a multidisciplinary team. Feeding difficulties should be managed aggressively, including use of a nasogastric tube or gastrostomy tube when the risk for aspiration is high. Physical therapy can help maintain muscle function; a physical medicine and rehabilitation (PM&R) specialist can help those who have difficulty walking. A pulmonologist can oversee chest physiotherapy to improve pulmonary function, reduce the risk of pulmonary infection, and manage respiratory insufficiency, if present. Hearing loss and seizures are managed in a standard manner. Prevention of secondary complications: Chest physiotherapy can help reduce the risk of pulmonary infection; physical therapy can help prevent joint contractures. Surveillance: No clinical guidelines are available. Treating physicians should consider: routine evaluation of growth and weight, pulmonary function tests with consideration of blood gases, neurodevelopmental assessments at each visit, and at least annual audiology evaluations in those with infantile-onset disease. Genetic counseling TK2-related mtDNA maintenance defect is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier.

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics The clinical features of TNXB-related classical-like Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (clEDS) strongly resemble those seen in classic EDS (cEDS). Affected individuals have generalized joint hypermobility, hyperextensible skin, and easy bruising, but do not have atrophic scarring, as is seen in cEDS. There are also several other distinguishing clinical findings including anomalies of feet and hands, edema in the legs in the absence of cardiac failure, mild proximal and distal muscle weakness, and axonal polyneuropathy. Vaginal, uterine, and/or rectal prolapse can also occur. Tissue fragility with resulting rupture of the trachea, esophagus, and small and large bowel has been reported. Vascular fragility causing a major event occurs in a minority of individuals. Significant variability in the severity of musculoskeletal symptoms and their effect on day-to-day function between unrelated affected individuals as well as among affected individuals in the same family has been reported. Fatigue has been reported in more than half of affected individuals. The severity of symptoms in middle-aged individuals can range from joint hypermobility without complications to being wheelchair-bound as a result of severe and painful foot deformities and fatigue.

Management GeneReviews Treatment of manifestations: Non-weight-bearing exercise, physical therapy, and careful selection of analgesic medication to address joint pain; if pain is severe or debilitating, consider referral to a pain management specialist or clinic. The use of opioid medication should be avoided for chronic pain, as this does not lead to long-term pain relief and has the potential for addiction issues. Long-term chronic pain may result in the need for mental health services. Prompt assessment and management in a tertiary center is required for bowel rupture, arterial rupture, or organ rupture. Ascorbic acid (vitamin C) may reduce easy bruising but has no effect on the key characteristics of skin hyperextensibility and joint hypermobility. DDAVP (deamino-delta-D- arginine vasopressin) may also be useful to normalize bleeding time in those with easy bruising. Standard treatment is applicable for joint dislocations, subjective muscle weakness, and cardiac abnormalities. Prevention of primary manifestations: Maintenance of a health body weight; low threshold for referral to gastroenterologist for evaluation of gastrointestinal symptoms; special attention during general anesthesia in order to provide adequate positioning and support as well as being aware of tissue fragility, which has been reported after intubation. Avoid invasive procedures unless absolutely medically necessary; consider carrying medical information or wearing jewelry denoting an increased risk of tissue fragility. Surveillance: Routine follow up ideally with rheumatologist, pain management clinic, and/or specialized EDS services, if available. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Sports with heavy joint strain, as well as contact sports; invasive procedures unless they are absolutely medically necessary; acetylsalicylate (aspirin) and long-term use of NSAIDS; use of opioid medication for chronic pain. Pregnancy management: It is important that the obstetrician and midwives are made aware of the diagnosis of clEDS during a pregnancy. Reported pregnancy and postpartum issues in affected women include miscarriage, premature rupture of membranes, post- or peripartum hemorrhage, and prolapse of the rectum, vagina, and/or uterus. Specialist delivery is strongly advised in view of reported trachea rupture during intubation and esophagus rupture after insertion of a transesophageal ultrasound probe. Genetic counseling TNXB-related clED is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. If both parents are known to be heterozygous for a TNXB pathogenic variant, each sib of an affected individual has at conception a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being heterozygous, and a 25% chance of inheriting neither of the familial pathogenic variants. Once the TNXB pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member, carrier testing and prenatal/preimplantation genetic testing are theoretically possible."

Both TRPS types are characterized by distinctive facial features (large nose with broad nasal ridge and tip and underdeveloped alae; thick and broad medial eyebrows; long philtrum; thin vermilion of the upper lip; and large prominent ears); ectodermal features (fine, sparse, depigmented, and slow-growing hair and dystrophic nails); and skeletal findings (short stature, brachydactyly with ulnar or radial deviation of the fingers, short feet, and early, marked hip dysplasia). TRPS II is additionally characterized by multiple osteochondromas and an increased risk of mild- to-moderate intellectual disability. Diagnosis/testing The clinical diagnosis of TRPS can be established in a proband with characteristic facial features, ectodermal and joint manifestations, and skeletal findings of cone-shaped epiphyses.

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics TNF receptor-associated periodic fever syndrome (TRAPS) is characterized by episodes of inflammation typically occurring every four to six weeks and lasting between five and 25 days. Flares may be prompted by stress, infection, trauma, hormonal changes, and vaccination. Symptoms may include fever, abdominal pain, arthralgia, myalgia, migratory rash, and eye inflammation, with variable severity. Symptoms often begin in early childhood (median age 4.3 years), though symptom onset can occur later in life. During a flare, acute-phase reactants such as C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and serum amyloid A are typically elevated. Generally, acute-phase reactants stabilize between flares but may remain somewhat elevated even in the absence of clinical symptoms. AA amyloidosis, the most severe sequela of TRAPS, can largely be avoided with adequate treatment. Proteinuria and kidney failure occur in 80%-90% of affected individuals with amyloidosis, while intestinal, thyroid, myocardium, liver, and spleen deposits are less common. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of TRAPS is established in a proband with at least one suggestive clinical feature and a heterozygous pathogenic (or likely pathogenic) variant in TNFRSF1A identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Interleukin-1 (IL-1) inhibitors (anakinra or canakinumab) are considered first-line therapies. Another treatment option is the use of TNF inhibitors (most commonly etanercept), which may be considered in refractory situations. The use of corticosteroids may be useful as needed during an acute attack but is not sufficient for long-term management or for preventing amyloidosis.

Prevention of secondary manifestations: IL-1 inhibitors and the TNF inhibitor etanercept control the severity of disease flares and are effective in preventing AA amyloidosis. Surveillance: Complete physical examination with blood pressure and other vital signs, full skin examination, assessment for the presence of lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly, and musculoskeletal evaluation should be performed yearly, or more frequently if clinically indicated. The following are also recommended on an annual basis (or more frequently if indicated): measurement of CRP, ESR, serum level of AA amyloid, fibrinogen, haptoglobin, and complete blood count with differential, liver and renal function tests, urinalysis, quantitative immunoglobulins, QuantiFERON to screen for tuberculosis (for those on biologic treatment), ophthalmologic evaluation, and assessment of the Autoinflammatory Diseases Activity Index (AIDAI). Imaging of the abdomen to assess for splenomegaly/hepatomegaly may also be considered if there are findings of serum AA amyloid or suspected spleen or liver enlargement on physical exam. Agents/circumstances to avoid: For affected individuals managed with continuous biologic agents, consideration should be given to whether live-attenuated versus non-live vaccines should be administered. Data on the effect of live-attenuated vaccines is limited, and risks/benefits should be considered. It should be noted that affected individuals may have severe, paradoxical reactions that have been associated with anti-TNF monoclonal antibodies. Pregnancy management: To date, no pattern of birth anomalies with either the anti-IL-1 or TNF inhibitor medication classes has been reported. The use of corticosteroids during human pregnancy has been associated with an increased risk of cleft lip with or without cleft palate in exposed fetuses.

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Infants with untreated TRMU deficiency, a mitochondrial disorder, typically become symptomatic between ages two and four months with transient acute liver dysfunction (including elevated transaminases, abnormal synthetic functions, and/or hepatomegaly), metabolic derangements (severe persistent lactic acidosis, hypoglycemia, hyperammonemia), and poor weight gain. With proper supportive treatment (but not disease- targeted therapy), abnormal liver findings (including coagulopathy) improve or normalize. Likewise, metabolic derangements improve. However, other manifestations typical of a mitochondrial disorder such as persistent lactic acidosis, neurologic dysfunction (including developmental delay / intellectual disability and seizures), cardiomyopathy, and respiratory failure may persist or develop or over time. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of TRMU deficiency is established in a proband with suggestive findings and biallelic pathogenic (or likely pathogenic) variants in TRMU identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Targeted therapies: L-cysteine, with or without N-acetylcysteine (NAC), should be initiated as soon as a diagnosis of TRMU deficiency is suspected. Because the endogenous supply of cysteine is normally low in the first few months of life and because the enzyme TRMU requires adequate amounts of cysteine to enable the essential function of thiolating mitochondrial transfer RNAs, the initial manifestations of TRMU deficiency (primarily hepatopathy) may be reversed, ameliorated, or in some cases prevented by exogenous oral cysteine supplementation in infants with TRMU deficiency. To date, two infants treated presymptomatically overall had a milder clinical course than their affected relatives.

GeneReviews Liver transplantation: Liver transplantation is indicated when hepatopathy does not respond to medical interventions. Supportive care: Supportive care by a multidisciplinary team of clinicians, including a hepatologist, neurologist, and medical geneticist, is recommended to manage the commonly reported complications of developmental delay / intellectual disability, cardiomyopathy, seizures, and/or respiratory failure. Surveillance: Routine follow up is recommended to monitor response to L-cysteine and NAC supplementation, to evaluate response to supportive interventions, and to identify emergence of new findings or concerns regarding developmental/educational progress such as persistent neurodevelopmental delay or new onset of seizures that may develop over time. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Avoid medications that increase metabolic demand (such as corticosteroids) or inhibit mitochondrial activity (such as valproic acid and prolonged propofol infusion) and fasting, as it increases metabolic demand and may exacerbate hypoglycemia. Consider avoiding acetaminophen (paracetamol) during episodes of liver dysfunction based on theoretical concerns for oxidative stress. Evaluation of relatives at risk: Molecular genetic prenatal testing of fetuses at risk may be performed via amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling to inform maternal cysteine supplementation (reported in one pregnancy) and to facilitate institution of exogenous cysteine supplementation (as L-cysteine, N-acetylcysteine, or both) at birth. If prenatal testing has not been performed on a pregnancy at risk, supplementation with L- cysteine (and possibly N-acetylcysteine) of an at-risk newborn sib should be offered until molecular genetic testing for the family-specific TRMU pathogenic variants has been completed.

If both parents are known to be heterozygous for a TRMU pathogenic variant, each sib of an affected individual has at conception a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of inheriting neither of the familial TRMU pathogenic variants. Once the TRMU pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member, molecular genetic carrier testing and prenatal/preimplantation genetic testing are possible."

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics TUBB4A-related leukodystrophy comprises a phenotypic spectrum in which the MRI findings range from hypomyelination with atrophy of the basal ganglia and cerebellum (H-ABC) at the severe end to isolated hypomyelination at the mild end. Progressive neurologic findings reflect involvement of the pyramidal tracts (spasticity, brisk deep tendon reflexes, and Babinski sign), extrapyramidal system (rigidity, dystonia, choreoathetosis, oculogyric crisis, and perioral dyskinesia), cerebellum (ataxia, intention tremor, dysmetria), and bulbar function (dysarthria, dysphonia, and swallowing). Cognition is variably affected, usually less severely than motor function. Typically, those with H-ABC present in early childhood (ages 1-3 years) and those with isolated hypomyelination in later childhood or adulthood. The rate of progression varies with disease severity. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis is established in a proband with characteristic clinical and MRI findings and a heterozygous TUBB4A pathogenic variant identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Functionally disabling spasticity requires medical management and physical therapy; dystonia requires medical management and when refractory to medical management possibly surgical intervention. Swallowing dysfunction may require use of a gastrostomy tube for feeding. Seizures, constipation, and gastroesophageal reflux disease are treated in the routine manner. Prevention of secondary complications: Calcium and vitamin D supplementation as required to prevent osteoporosis; attention to skin care and frequent repositioning to help prevent pressure sores in individuals with decreased mobility; annual flu vaccination; use of routine fall prevention strategies, adaptive equipment (e.g., wheelchairs and walkers), and physical therapy to help prevent secondary injury.

Bladder voiding dysfunction can present before birth as megacystis. In infancy and later childhood, UFS can present with a poor urinary stream and dribbling incontinence; incomplete bladder emptying can lead to urinary infection with progressive kidney failure. Investigations after birth can show abnormal bladder contractility and vesicoureteral reflux of urine into the ureter and renal pelvis. Nocturnal lagophthalmos (incomplete closing of the eyes during sleep) has also been documented. Diagnosis/testing The clinical diagnosis of UFS can be established in an individual with urinary tract dysfunction and characteristic facial movement with expression, or the molecular diagnosis can be established in an individual with characteristic features and biallelic pathogenic variants in either HPSE2 or LRIG2 identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Rapid and complete antibiotic therapy for acute urinary tract infections. Anticholinergic and alpha-1 adrenergic blocking medications can respectively lower raised pressure within the bladder and enhance voiding of urine. Drug treatment can be complemented by intermittent catheterization per urethra or through vesicostomy.

The severe early-onset cardiac and multiorgan failure form typically presents in the first months of life with hypertrophic or dilated cardiomyopathy, pericardial effusion, and arrhythmias, as well as hypotonia, hepatomegaly, and intermittent hypoglycemia. The hepatic or hypoketotic hypoglycemic form typically presents during early childhood with hypoketotic hypoglycemia and hepatomegaly, but without cardiomyopathy. The later-onset episodic myopathic form presents with intermittent rhabdomyolysis provoked by exercise, muscle cramps and/or pain, and/or exercise intolerance. Hypoglycemia typically is not present at the time of symptoms.

Following the International Society for the Study of Vascular Anomalies (ISSVA) classification, these include common VM (unifocal/isolated VM or multifocal sporadic VM [MSVM]), multiple cutaneous and mucosal VM (VMCM), and blue rubber bleb nevus (BRBN) syndrome. VM are usually present at birth and grow with time, and new lesions can appear over time in individuals with MSVM, VMCM, and BRBN syndrome. Small lesions are usually asymptomatic; larger lesions can extend into other tissues, including subcutaneous tissues and muscles, causing pain and functional limitations.

Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) should be administered prior to any invasive procedure (sclerotherapy and/or surgery) to avoid disseminated intravascular coagulopathy. If D-dimers are elevated and fibrinogen levels are low, LMWH should be initiated one to two weeks before surgery, depending on severity of coagulation abnormality, and continued for two weeks after surgery. If fibrinogen levels are normal, LMWH can be initiated the day before surgery. If lesions are painful and D-dimers are elevated, LMWH can also be used to treat the associated pain.

Individuals on sirolimus should be closely followed at the beginning and throughout the course of their treatment, in order to modify the dosage as well as manage adverse events. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Contraceptive pills with high estrogen concentration. Evaluation of relatives at risk: Physical examination of at-risk neonates to identify those who can benefit from early treatment. Pregnancy management: D-dimer levels should be evaluated every one to three months during pregnancy (depending on the symptoms) and prior to delivery to adjust LMWH therapy and to avoid abnormal bleeding during delivery. Genetic counseling TEK-related VM are either inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion (TEK-related VMCM) or caused by somatic (mosaic) variants (TEK-related unifocal VM, MSVM, and BRBN syndrome). For TEK-related VMCM, most individuals have an affected parent. The proportion of cases caused by a de novo pathogenic variant is unknown; none have been reported to date. In some affected individuals, lesions are small. Therefore, careful skin examination is needed in order to determine if a family member is affected. Each child of an individual with TEK-related VMCM has a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant. Prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk is possible if the TEK pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member. With regards to other TEK-related phenotypes, unifocal VM, MSVM, and BRBN syndrome are not known to be inherited, as identified pathogenic variants to date are somatic (mosaic). No confirmed vertical transmission or sib recurrence has been reported to date. The risk to sibs of a proband with somatic mosaicism for a pathogenic variant in TEK would be expected to be the same as in the general population. Due to mosaicism, the risk for transmission to offspring is expected to be less than 50%."

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Hepatic veno-occlusive disease with immunodeficiency (VODI) is characterized by: (1) primary immunodeficiency; and (2) terminal hepatic lobular vascular occlusion and hepatic fibrosis manifest as hepatomegaly and/or hepatic failure. Onset is usually before age six months. The immunodeficiency comprises severe hypogammaglobulinemia, clinical evidence of T-cell immunodeficiency with normal numbers of circulating T cells, absent lymph node germinal centers, and absent tissue plasma cells. Bacterial and opportunistic infections including Pneumocystis jirovecii infection, mucocutaneous candidiasis, and enteroviral or cytomegalovirus infections occur. In the past the prognosis for affected individuals was poor, with 100% mortality in the first year of life if unrecognized and untreated with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and Pneumocystis jirovecii prophylaxis. However, with early recognition and treatment there is a marked improvement in prognosis.

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics VPS35-related Parkinson disease (PARK-VPS35) is indistinguishable from Parkinson disease of unknown cause representing a simplex case (also referred to as \\\"sporadic\\\" Parkinson disease). PARK-VPS35 is characterized by typical parkinsonism (resting tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity, disturbance of postural reflexes) presenting on average a decade earlier than in individuals with simplex Parkinson disease of unknown cause. Median age of onset is approximately 50 years, with a range of onset spanning the third to eighth decade of life. PARK-VPS35 subtypes can include tremor dominant, akinetic rigid, gait difficulty, or mixed. Asymmetric presentation is typical. The disease course is usually milder than that of simplex Parkinson disease of unknown cause, with a decreased incidence of atypical signs. Dyskinesia and motor fluctuations may occur. Neuropsychiatric manifestations (depression and schizophrenia), learning difficulties, mild cognitive impairment, and dementia have been reported, albeit with lower occurrence than in simplex Parkinson disease of unknown cause. Additional findings include impaired sense of smell and autonomic manifestations including orthostasis and constipation. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of PARK-VPS35 is established in a proband with parkinsonism (bradykinesia with rigidity and/or resting tremor) and a heterozygous VPS35 pathogenic variant identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: To date, treatment of PARK-VPS35 does not differ from that of simplex Parkinson disease of unknown cause. Drugs to treat motor manifestations include levodopa, in combination with a peripheral dopa decarboxylase inhibitor (carbidopa, benserazide), dopamine agonists, inhibitors of catechol-O- methyltransferase or monoamine oxidase-B, anticholinergics, and amantadine.

GeneReviews levodopa and other dopaminergic medications. Individuals benefit from physical, occupational, and speech therapies. Due to the lower risk of atypical signs, neuropsychiatric disturbances, and dementia, individuals with PARK-VPS35 seem to be good candidates for treatment with dopamine agonists. In addition, in those with dyskinesia and motor fluctuations, subthalamic deep brain stimulation and apomorphine intermittent injections or continuous therapy with an infusion pump should be considered. Peak-dose dyskinesia may be ameliorated with amantadine and dopaminergic treatment reduction (if tolerated). Low-dose clozapine, quetiapine, or pimavanserin and reduction of dopaminergic therapy can decrease delusions and hallucinations. Standard treatments for depression; consider droxidopa for orthostasis; symptomatic treatment for constipation. Surveillance: Neurologic evaluations to assess tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity, gait, neuropsychiatric symptoms, cognition, and treatment efficacy every six to 12 months or as needed; neuropsychiatric and cognitive assessments as needed; assess for symptoms of orthostasis, measure blood pressure, and assess for constipation at each visit; echocardiogram as needed in those treated with ergot-derived dopamine agonists; assess family and social work needs at each visit. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Drugs that may induce or exacerbate parkinsonism include but are not limited to neuroleptics, antidepressants, calcium channel blockers, valproate, lithium, and amiodarone. Ergot-derived dopaminergic drugs should be discontinued if fibrotic heart-valve changes are identified. Genetic counseling PARK-VPS35 is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. About 90% of individuals diagnosed with PARK- VPS35 have positive family history of Parkinson disease. Each child of an individual with PARK-VPS35 has a 50% chance of inheriting the VPS35 pathogenic variant.

In rare instances, IRF6 pathogenic variants have also been reported in individuals with nonsyndromic orofacial cleft (18/3,811; 0.47%) and in individuals with spina bifida (2/192). Individuals with VWS show one or more of the following anomalies: Congenital, usually bilateral, paramedian lower-lip fistulae (pits) or sometimes small mounds with a sinus tract leading from a mucous gland of the lip Cleft lip (CL) Cleft palate (CP) Note: Cleft lip with or without cleft palate (CLP) is observed about twice as often as CP only.

GeneReviews Anomalies of the skin around the nails A characteristic pyramidal fold of skin overlying the nail of the hallux (almost pathognomonic) In some nonclassic forms of PPS: filiform synechiae connecting the upper and lower jaws (syngnathia) or the upper and lower eyelids (ankyloblepharon) Other musculoskeletal anomalies may include spina bifida occulta, talipes equinovarus, digital reduction, bifid ribs, and short sternum. In VWS, PPS, IRF6-related neural tube defect, and IRF6-related orofacial cleft, growth and intelligence are typical. Diagnosis/testing Diagnosis of an IRF6-related disorder is established in a proband with suggestive findings and a heterozygous pathogenic variant in IRF6 identified by molecular genetic testing. A heterozygous pathogenic variant in IRF6 is identified in approximately 72% of individuals with the VWS phenotype, approximately 97% of individuals with the PPS phenotype, and fewer than 1% of individuals with a neural tube defect or orofacial cleft. Management Treatment of manifestations: Supportive/symptomatic treatment of VWS and PPS may include surgical treatment of lip pits and cleft lip and palate pediatric dentistry, orthodontia, speech therapy, feeding therapy, timely treatment of otitis media due to eustachian tube dysfunction to prevent secondary hearing loss, physical therapy, orthopedic care, and surgical treatment for cryptorchidism. Surgical treatment may be needed for those with oral and/or eyelid synechiae. IRF6-related neural tube defects are treated in a standard manner as per neurosurgeon. IRF6-related orofacial clefts are treated in a standard manner. Surveillance: Surveillance for those with cleft lip and/or cleft palate includes weekly assessment of nutritional intake and weight gain during the first month of life; otolaryngologic evaluation within the first six months of life and continued throughout adolescence; audiologic evaluation with infant's first visit to cleft clinic, with the frequency of subsequent evaluations based on the history of ear disease or hearing loss; speech-language pathology evaluation by age six months, twice during the first two years of life, at least annually until age six years, at least annually until after adenoid involution, and at least every two years until dental and skeletal maturity; dental evaluation within six months of the first tooth erupting and no later than age 12 months, and routine dental evaluation continued throughout life. In individuals with myelomeningocele, assessment of walking and mobility and bowel and bladder management with each visit throughout life. Genetic counseling IRF6-related disorders are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Most individuals diagnosed with an IRF6-related clefting disorder (e.g., VWS or PPS) inherited an IRF6 pathogenic variant from a heterozygous parent who may or may not have manifestations of the disorder. The risk to the sibs of the proband depends on the genetic status of the proband's parents: if a parent of the proband is affected and/or has an IRF6 pathogenic variant, the risk to the sibs of inheriting the pathogenic variant is 50%. Once an IRF6 pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible. Prenatal ultrasound examination may detect a cleft lip with/without cleft palate in some fetuses later in the second trimester, but it is much less likely to detect an isolated cleft palate or lip pits.

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics The current (but limited) understanding of the WARS2 deficiency phenotypic spectrum, based on 29 individuals from 24 families reported to date, can be viewed as a clustering of hallmark features within the broad phenotypes of epilepsy and movement disorder. The epilepsy spectrum encompasses neonatal- or infantile-onset developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE) and other less well described seizure types. DEE manifests mostly in the neonatal period or within the first year of life. Seizures are generally difficult to control and may lead to status epilepticus and death. Over time the following become evident: global developmental delay, mild-to-severe intellectual disability, speech impairment (slurred and slow speech, dysarthria or no speech production but preserved receptive speech), weakness and muscle atrophy, motor hyperactivity with athetosis, and neuropsychiatric manifestations including aggressiveness and sleep disorders. The movement disorder spectrum encompasses the overlapping phenotypes of levodopa-responsive parkinsonism/dystonia and progressive myoclonus-ataxia/hyperkinetic movement disorder and is primarily associated with childhood or early adulthood onset. Of note, the continua within and between the epilepsy spectrum and the movement disorder spectrum remain to be determined pending reporting of more individuals with WARS2 deficiency. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of WARS2 deficiency is established in a proband with suggestive findings and biallelic pathogenic variants in WARS2 identified by molecular genetic testing. Of note, to date all individuals with a childhood- or early adulthood-onset movement disorder have the hypomorphic WARS2 variant c.37T>G (p.Trp13Gly) in trans with a WARS2 pathogenic variant.

Copyright 1993-2024, University of Washington, Seattle. GeneReviews is a registered trademark of the University of Washington, Seattle. All rights reserved. Management GeneReviews Treatment of manifestations: There is no known cure for WARS2 deficiency. Supportive care to improve quality of life, maximize function, and reduce complications is recommended. Supportive treatment of WARS2-related DEE ideally involves multidisciplinary care by specialists in child neurology (treatment of seizures), nutrition/ feeding, pulmonology, physical therapy, developmental pediatrics, social work, medical ethics, and medical genetics. Supportive treatment of WARS2-related movement disorders ideally involves multidisciplinary care by specialists in neurology (treatment of movement disorders), physiatry, physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech-language pathology (including consideration of augmentative and alternative communication), developmental pediatrics, mental health, social work, and medical genetics. Of note, individuals with parkinsonism show an overall good response to dopaminergic therapy, mostly to levodopa (alternatively, dopamine receptor agonists). Surveillance: Because most infants and young children with WARS2-related DEE are severely affected and may be hospitalized for prolonged periods, it is recommended that they be reviewed regularly by senior clinical specialists when hospitalized. For individuals with a WARS2-related movement disorder, it is recommended that monitoring of existing manifestations, the individual's response to supportive care, and the emergence of new manifestations follow the recommendations of the treating specialists. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Valproic acid has caused severe hepatopathy and neurologic deterioration in one individual with WARS2-related DEE. Genetic counseling WARS2 deficiency is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. If both parents are known to be heterozygous for a WARS2 pathogenic variant or hypomorphic variant, each sib of an affected individual has at conception a 25% chance of inheriting biallelic variants, a 50% chance of inheriting one variant, and a 25% chance of inheriting neither of the familial WARS2 variants. Sibs who inherit: Biallelic loss-of-function pathogenic variants are likely to have WARS2-related epilepsy; A WARS2 loss-of-function pathogenic variant in trans with the hypomorphic WARS2 variant are likely to have a WARS2-related movement disorder; One variant (either a pathogenic variant or a hypomorphic variant) are asymptomatic and are not at risk of developing WARS2 deficiency; Neither of the familial WARS2 variants are unaffected and not carriers. Once the WARS2 deficiency-related variants have been identified in an affected family member, carrier testing for at-risk relatives and prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing are possible."

Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome usually presents in infancy. Affected males have thrombocytopenia with intermittent mucosal bleeding, bloody diarrhea, and intermittent or chronic petechiae and purpura; recurrent bacterial, viral, fungal, and/or opportunistic infections; and eczema. Approximately 25%-40% of those who survive the early complications develop one or more autoimmune conditions including hemolytic anemia, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, immune-mediated neutropenia, vasculitis, rheumatoid arthritis, and immune- mediated damage to the kidneys and liver. Individuals with a WAS-related disorder, particularly those who have been exposed to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), are at increased risk of developing lymphomas, which often occur in unusual extranodal locations including the brain, lung, or gastrointestinal tract. Males with XLT have small platelet volume and thrombocytopenia. Severe disease-related events include severe bleeding episodes (14%), autoimmunity (12%), life-threatening infections (7%), and malignancy (5%). Males with XLN typically have congenital neutropenia associated with myelodysplasia, hyperactive neutrophils, increased myeloid cell apoptosis, and lymphoid cell abnormalities.

Diagnosis/testing GeneReviews The diagnosis of a WAS-related disorder is established in a male proband with both congenital thrombocytopenia (<70,000 platelets/mm3) and small platelets; at least one of the following features: eczema, recurrent bacterial, viral, and fungal infections, autoimmune disease(s), malignancy, reduced WASP expression in a fresh blood sample, abnormal antibody response to polysaccharide antigens and/or low isohemagglutinins, or positive maternal family history of a WAS-related disorder; and a hemizygous WAS pathogenic variant identified by molecular genetic testing (necessary to confirm the diagnosis). The diagnosis of a WAS-related disorder in a female is uncommon. It is usually established by identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in WAS by molecular genetic testing in a female with severe skewed X- chromosome inactivation and increased expression of the mutated WAS allele. Management Targeted therapy: The only curative targeted therapy clinically available for Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome is allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). In those with XLT, decision to treat with HSCT is determined on an individual basis. Treatment of manifestations: In those with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome and XLT, treatment is individualized based on disease manifestations and includes management of thrombocytopenia; prevention of infection with immunoglobulin replacement; topical steroids for eczema; antibiotics as needed for chronic skin infections; prophylactic antibiotics for Pneumocystis jirovecii in infants with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome; intravenous immunoglobulin G; routine non-live immunizations; prompt evaluation and treatment for infection including empiric parenteral antibiotics and exhaustive search for source of infection; and judicious use of immunosuppressants for autoimmune disease prior to definitive treatment. In those with XLN, treatment includes granulocyte colony-stimulating factor therapy; routine non-live immunizations; prompt evaluation and treatment for infection including empiric parenteral antibiotics and exhaustive search for source of infection; and treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myelogenous leukemia per hematologist/oncologist. Surveillance: Complete blood count including platelet count and size and assessment for complications associated with increased bleeding as recommended by hematologist; annual skin examination; assessment by immunologist including for recurrent infections with frequency as recommended by immunologist; annual clinical assessment for autoimmune dysfunction and for manifestations of lymphoma. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Circumcision of at-risk newborn males who have thrombocytopenia; use of medications that interfere with platelet function. Defer elective procedures until after HSCT. Evaluation of relatives at risk: Evaluation of at-risk newborn males so that morbidity and mortality can be reduced by early diagnosis and treatment. Evaluation of relatives considering stem cell donation to inform transplant donor decision making. Genetic counseling WAS-related disorders are inherited in an X-linked manner. If the mother of the proband has a WAS pathogenic variant, the chance of transmitting it in each pregnancy is 50%. Males who inherit the pathogenic variant will be symptomatic. Females who inherit the pathogenic variant will be carriers and are typically asymptomatic. Males with a WAS-related disorder transmit the pathogenic variant to all of their daughters and none of their sons. Once the WAS pathogenic variant has been identified in a family member, molecular genetic testing to identify female heterozygotes and prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.

Brain MRI has identified abnormalities in a few individuals with EZH2-related overgrowth. Neuroblastoma occurs at a slightly increased frequency in individuals with a heterozygous EZH2 pathogenic variant, but data are insufficient to determine absolute risk. There is currently no evidence that additional malignancies (including hematologic malignancies) occur with increased frequency, though a few have been reported. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of EZH2-related overgrowth is based on detection of a heterozygous germline EZH2 pathogenic variant on molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: For individuals with developmental delay and/or learning disability, referral for learning/behavior/speech assessment and support may be indicated. Occasionally, toe camptodactyly may require surgical release. Physiotherapy may be of benefit to those experiencing joint pain secondary to ligamentous laxity or joint contractures. Standard treatment with appropriate specialist referral(s) is indicated for epilepsy, scoliosis, and other clinical issues. Surveillance: Regular medical follow up of young children with EZH2-related overgrowth to monitor developmental progress, camptodactyly (for resolution/improvement), and/or hypotonia; medical follow up of older children/teenagers who do not have medical complications may be less frequent. If scoliosis is present, monitoring per the recommendations of an orthopedist.

The ocular problems, typically recognized in childhood, include microspherophakia (small spherical lens), myopia secondary to the abnormal shape of the lens, ectopia lentis (abnormal position of the lens), and glaucoma, which can lead to blindness. Height of adult males is 142-169 cm; height of adult females is 130-157 cm. Autosomal recessive WMS cannot be distinguished from autosomal dominant WMS by clinical findings alone. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis WMS is established in a proband with characteristic clinical features. Identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in ADAMTS10, ADAMTS17, or LTBP2 or of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in FBN1 by molecular genetic testing can confirm the diagnosis if clinical features are inconclusive. Management Treatment of manifestations: Early detection and removal of an ectopic lens to decrease the possibility of pupillary block and glaucoma. Surgical management of glaucoma can include peripheral iridectomy to prevent or relieve pupillary block and trabeculectomy in advanced chronic angle closure glaucoma; medical treatment of glaucoma is difficult because of paradoxic response to miotics and mydriatics. Consider physical therapy for joint issues. Careful evaluation prior to anesthesia because of stiff joints, poorly aligned teeth, and maxillary hypoplasia.

The diagnosis is established in a proband with suggestive findings and a heterozygous pathogenic (or likely pathogenic) variant identified by molecular genetic testing. Management There is no cure for WFS1-SD. Treatment of manifestations: Supportive care (based on the manifestations of classic or nonclassic WFS1-SD) is often provided by multidisciplinary specialists in diabetic care, endocrinology, ophthalmology and low vision, audiology, speech-language therapy, neurology, pulmonology, psychiatry / psychology / mental health, urology, gastroenterology, social work, and medical genetics. Surveillance: For both classic and nonclassic WFS1-SD, regular monitoring of existing manifestations, the response of an individual to supportive care, and the emergence of new manifestations is recommended. Evaluation of relatives at risk: It is appropriate to clarify the genetic status of apparently asymptomatic at-risk relatives in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from prompt initiation of treatment for the earliest manifestations of WFS1-SD: diabetes mellitus, optic atrophy, and sensorineural hearing loss. Pregnancy management: Pregnant women with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, a characteristic of both classic and nonclassic WFS1-SD, have a two- to eightfold higher risk of having a child with a birth defect or a pattern of birth defects (diabetic embryopathy) than women who do not have diabetes. Optimizing glucose control before and during pregnancy can reduce but not eliminate the risk for diabetic embryopathy. Because women with classic WFS1-SD may develop diabetes insipidus during pregnancy, monitoring for diabetes insipidus during pregnancy is warranted. Consultation with a maternal fetal medicine specialist during pregnancy should be considered for all women with WFS1-SD. Genetic counseling Classic WFS1-SD is caused by biallelic WFS1 pathogenic variants and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. If both parents are known to be heterozygous for a WFS1 pathogenic variant, each sib of an affected individual has at conception a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being a carrier, and a 25% chance of inheriting neither of the familial pathogenic variants. Nonclassic WFS1-SD is caused by a heterozygous pathogenic variant and can either be inherited in an autosomal dominant manner from an affected parent or result from a de novo WFS1 pathogenic variant. If a parent of the proband is affected and/or is known to have the pathogenic variant identified in the proband, the risk to sibs of inheriting the pathogenic variant is 50%. If the WFS1 pathogenic variant identified in the proband cannot be detected in the leukocyte DNA of either parent, the recurrence risk to sibs is estimated to be 1% because of the theoretic possibility of parental germline mosaicism. Both classic and nonclassic WFS1-SD. Once the WFS1 pathogenic variant(s) have been identified in an affected family member, prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing for classic and nonclassic WFS1-SD are possible."

Clinical characteristics Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome (WHS) is characterized by typical craniofacial features in infancy consisting of \\\"Greek warrior helmet\\\" appearance of the nose (wide bridge of the nose continuing to the forehead), microcephaly, high anterior hairline with prominent glabella, widely spaced eyes, epicanthus, highly arched eyebrows, short philtrum, downturned corners of the mouth, micrognathia, and poorly formed ears with pits/ tags. All affected individuals have prenatal-onset growth deficiency followed by postnatal growth retardation and hypotonia with muscle underdevelopment. Developmental delay/intellectual disability of variable degree is present in all. Seizures occur in 90% to 100% of children with WHS. Other findings include skeletal anomalies (60%-70%), congenital heart defects (~50%), hearing loss (mostly conductive) (>40%), urinary tract malformations (25%), and structural brain abnormalities (33%). Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of WHS is established by the finding of a heterozygous deletion of the Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome critical region (WHSCR) on chromosome 4p16.3 by chromosomal microarray (CMA), conventional G-banded cytogenetic analysis, or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH).

Surveillance: Systematic follow up to monitor rehabilitation and treatment as needed; annual complete blood count and renal function testing; consideration of routine liver ultrasounds. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Carbamazepine may worsen atypical absence seizures. Genetic counseling WHS is caused by deletion of the WHSCR of chromosome 4p16.3 by one of several genetic mechanisms. About 50%-60% of individuals with WHS have a de novo pure deletion of 4p16 and about 40%-45% have an unbalanced translocation with both a deletion of 4p and a partial trisomy of a different chromosome arm. These unbalanced translocations may be de novo or inherited from a parent with a balanced rearrangement. The remaining have other complex rearrangements leading to a 4p16.3 deletion (e.g., ring 4). Risks to family members depend on the mechanism of origin of the deletion. Prenatal testing is possible for families in which one parent is known to be a carrier of a chromosome rearrangement involving 4p16.3."

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Wilson disease is a disorder of copper metabolism that, when untreated, can present with hepatic, neurologic, or psychiatric disturbances or a combination of these in individuals ages three years to older than 70 years. Manifestations in untreated individuals vary among and within families. Liver disease can include recurrent jaundice, simple acute self-limited hepatitis-like illness, autoimmune- type hepatitis, fulminant hepatic failure, or chronic liver disease. Neurologic presentations can include dysarthria, movement disorders (tremors, involuntary movements, chorea, choreoathetosis), dystonia (mask-like facies, rigidity, gait disturbance, pseudobulbar involvement), dysautonomia, seizures, sleep disorders, or insomnia. Psychiatric disturbances can include depression, bipolar disorder / bipolar spectrum disorder, neurotic behaviors, personality changes, or psychosis. Other multisystem involvement can include the eye (Kayser-Fleischer rings), hemolytic anemia, the kidneys, the endocrine glands, and the heart. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of Wilson disease is established in most instances by a combination of biochemical findings (low serum ceruloplasmin concentration, low serum concentration of total copper, and increased urinary copper excretion) and/or detection of biallelic pathogenic (or likely pathogenic) variants in ATP7B identified by molecular genetic testing, based on the diagnostic scoring system developed at the 8th International Meeting on Wilson Disease. Management Treatment of manifestations: Lifelong medical interventions to prevent/treat copper accumulation need to be instituted as soon as possible in all individuals with Wilson disease whether they are asymptomatic (i.e., Author Affiliations: 1 Internal Medicine, Salem Medical Center, Heidelberg, Germany; Email: karlheinz.weiss@stadtmission-hd.de. 2 Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut; Email: michael.schilsky@yale.edu.

GeneReviews individuals with biallelic ATP7B pathogenic variants who have no clinical manifestations or tissue damage related to Wilson disease), clinically asymptomatic (i.e., individuals with biallelic ATP7B pathogenic variants who have no clinical manifestations of Wilson disease, but have Wilson disease-related tissue damage), or symptomatic (i.e., individuals with clinical manifestations of Wilson disease and Wilson disease-related tissue damage), regardless of age and including pregnant women. As Wilson disease treatment decisions might be complex, the consultation of disease experts (primarily hepatologists and neurologists) or Wilson disease centers of excellence is advised. The first-line therapy is copper chelating agents (D-penicillamine and trientine). Zinc salts (which interfere with absorption of copper from the gastrointestinal tract) cannot be used with a copper chelating agent and are most effective after initial decoppering with a chelating agent; however, in some individuals zinc salts can be used as an initial treatment. Orthotopic liver transplantation is used for individuals who fail to respond to medical therapy or present with fulminant acute liver failure. The goals of supportive treatment for extrahepatic manifestations of individuals with symptomatic Wilson disease are individualized to maximize function and reduce complications. Depending on their clinical manifestations, symptomatic individuals may require specialists in neurology, occupational therapy, physical therapy, physiatry, orthopedics, nutrition, speech-language pathology, social work, and psychology/psychiatry. Surveillance: To assess treatment effectiveness and adherence to medical interventions that prevent/treat copper accumulation, the following are recommended: At least twice annually: assessment of serum copper and ceruloplasmin levels, liver biochemistries, international normalized ratio, complete blood count, urinalysis, and physical examination including neurologic assessment At least once annually: measurement of 24-hour urinary excretion of copper Monitoring the individual's response to supportive treatment for extrahepatic manifestations and the emergence of new manifestations is per the recommendations of the treating clinical specialists. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Foods very high in copper (liver, brain, chocolate, mushrooms, shellfish, and nuts) should be avoided, especially at the beginning of treatment. In case of biochemical abnormalities in liver function tests or transaminases, alcohol consumption is strongly discouraged. Evaluation of relatives at risk: It is appropriate to clarify the genetic status of asymptomatic older and younger at- risk relatives of an affected individual in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from prompt initiation of medical interventions to prevent/treat copper accumulation. Pregnancy management: Treatment must be continued during pregnancy because of the risk for fulminant hepatic failure or irreversible neurologic deterioration. Because of possible adverse effects on the fetus from chelating agents, the dose should be kept as low as possible. Genetic counseling Wilson disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. If both parents are known to be heterozygous for an ATP7B pathogenic variant, each sib of an affected individual has at conception a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being heterozygous, and a 25% chance of inheriting neither of the familial pathogenic variants. Once both ATP7B pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member, carrier and predictive genetic testing for at-risk relatives, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk, and preimplantation genetic testing for Wilson disease are possible.

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Waardenburg syndrome type I (WS1) is an auditory-pigmentary disorder comprising congenital sensorineural hearing loss and pigmentary disturbances of the iris, hair, and skin along with dystopia canthorum (lateral displacement of the inner canthi). The hearing loss in WS1, observed in approximately 60% of affected individuals, is congenital, typically non-progressive, either unilateral or bilateral, and sensorineural. Most commonly, hearing loss in WS1 is bilateral and profound (>100 dB). The majority of individuals with WS1 have either a white forelock or early graying of the scalp hair before age 30 years. The classic white forelock observed in approximately 45% of individuals is the most common hair pigmentation anomaly seen in WS1. Affected individuals may have complete heterochromia iridium, partial/segmental heterochromia, or hypoplastic or brilliant blue irides. Congenital leukoderma is frequently seen on the face, trunk, or limbs. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of WS1 is established in most individuals by physical examination for clinical criteria including: sensorineural hearing loss, pigmentary changes in the hair and eyes, dystopia canthorum identified by calculation of the W index, and specific facial features. Identification of a heterozygous PAX3 pathogenic variant by molecular genetic testing establishes the diagnosis if clinical features are inconclusive. Management Treatment of manifestations: Management of the hearing loss depends on its severity; cochlear implantation has been successfully used in individuals with WS1. Evaluation of relatives at risk: If the family-specific PAX3 pathogenic variant is known, molecular genetic testing of relatives at risk allows for early screening of those at risk for hearing loss. Pregnancy management: Folic acid supplementation in pregnancy is recommended for women at increased risk of having a child with WS1 because of the possibly increased risk for neural tube defects associated with WS1.

Offspring of an individual with WS1 have a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant. If the pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk may be available from a clinical laboratory that offers either testing for this disease/gene or custom prenatal testing.

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Virtually all individuals with Woodhouse-Sakati syndrome (WSS) have the endocrine findings of hypogonadism (evident at puberty) and progressive childhood-onset hair thinning that often progresses to alopecia totalis in adulthood. More than half of individuals have the neurologic findings of progressive extrapyramidal movements (dystonic spasms with dystonic posturing with dysarthria and dysphagia), moderate bilateral postlingual sensorineural hearing loss, and mild intellectual disability. To date, more than 40 families (including 33 with a molecularly confirmed diagnosis) with a total of 88 affected individuals have been reported in the literature. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of WSS is established in a proband with suggestive clinical, neuroimaging, and neurophysiologic findings by identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in DCAF17 on molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Treatment is symptomatic and should be managed by a multidisciplinary team. Hypogonadism requires hormone replacement therapy to induce secondary sex characteristics and promote bone health at the usual age of puberty. Alopecia is treated symptomatically for cosmetic reasons only. Treatment for dystonia is routine; oral medications are tried first and followed in some instances by botulinum toxin injection and/or deep-brain stimulation. Dysarthria often benefits from consultation with a speech therapist. Those with dysphagia often require measures to reduce oral secretions, use of thickened liquids and pureed foods to avoid aspiration, and eventually a gastrostomy to help maintain caloric intake. Standard treatment for diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, hearing loss, and intellectual disability. Surveillance: Monitoring for endocrine abnormalities is recommended at the following ages: hypogonadism beginning at age 12-14 years; diabetes mellitus and hypothyroidism beginning at age 20 years; serum IGF-1 Author Affiliations: 1 Professor and Consultant, Department of Neurosciences King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; Email: boholega@kfshrc.edu.sa. 2 Neurologist, Department of Neurosciences King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; Email: aabusrair@moh.gov.sa.

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics X-linked acrogigantism is the occurrence of pituitary gigantism in an individual heterozygous or hemizygous for a germline or somatic duplication of GPR101. X-linked acrogigantism is characterized by acceleration of linear growth in early childhood in most cases during the first two years of life due to growth hormone (GH) excess. Most individuals with X-linked acrogigantism present with associated hyperprolactinemia due to a mixed GH- and prolactin-secreting pituitary adenoma with or without associated hyperplasia; less commonly they develop diffuse hyperplasia of the GH- and prolactin-secreting pituitary cells without a pituitary adenoma. Most affected individuals are females. Growth acceleration is the main presenting feature; other frequently observed clinical features include enlargement of hands and feet, coarsening of the facial features, and increased appetite. Neurologic signs or symptoms are rarely present. Untreated X-linked acrogigantism can lead to markedly increased stature, with obvious severe physical and psychological sequelae. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of X-linked acrogigantism is established in an individual with pituitary gigantism and a germline or somatic duplication of GPR101 identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: In patients with radiologic evidence of a pituitary adenoma: transsphenoidal surgery should be considered as first-line treatment as it can provide long-term control of the disease (although often at the cost of permanent hypopituitarism) and prevent excessive tumor growth; in those with persistent disease, GH receptor antagonist treatment should be promptly initiated and tailored to growth velocity and IGF-1 levels.

GeneReviews In patients with radiologic evidence of hyperplasia without a pituitary tumor: first-line treatment with GH receptor antagonist should be considered as surgery (which is not usually recommended) can lead to disease remission only by means of a total hypophysectomy, invariably resulting in the need for lifelong pituitary hormone replacement treatment. In patients with associated hyperprolactinemia: a dopamine agonist should be employed. Surveillance: Intensive monitoring of height, growth velocity, and pituitary function tests. Repeat pituitary MRI (with frequency based on presence of hyperplasia/tumor, previous extent of the tumor, treatment modality, clinical status, and disease activity). Routine surveillance for complications of GH excess (based on recommendations for patients with acromegaly). Genetic counseling X-linked acrogigantism is inherited in an X-linked manner. The majority of affected individuals represent simplex cases (i.e., a single occurrence in a family) resulting from a de novo GPR101 duplication; of note, all males who are simplex cases have had a somatic mosaic GPR101 duplication. In the three reported instances of familial X-linked acrogigantism, affected males inherited the GPR101 duplication from their affected mothers. Females with X-linked acrogigantism have a 50% chance of transmitting the GPR101 duplication in each pregnancy. While a male with a somatic mosaic GPR101 duplication that involves germ cells could theoretically transmit the duplication to his daughters, and a male with a germline GPR101 duplication will transmit the duplication to all of his daughters, to date male-to-female transmission has not been described. A male will not transmit the duplication to his sons. Offspring of either sex who inherit the GPR101 duplication will be affected. Once the GPR101 duplication has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing are possible."

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) involves the central or peripheral nervous system and the adrenal cortex. The nervous system and adrenal glands are involved independently; thus, an affected male may be diagnosed with cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy (CALD), adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN), and/or primary adrenocortical insufficiency. CALD is characterized by progressive behavioral, cognitive, and neurologic deficits; onset of symptoms ranges from childhood (typically ages 4 to 8 years) to adolescence (ages 11 to 21 years) and adulthood. AMN is characterized by leg weakness, spasticity, clumsy gait, pain, and bladder and bowel dysfunction; onset is typically in the 20s and 30s. Onset of primary adrenocortical insufficiency ranges from age two years to adulthood (most commonly by age 7.5 years). Heterozygous females are not at increased risk to develop CALD, but are at increased risk to develop AMN and primary adrenocortical insufficiency with increasing age. Diagnosis/testing Three scenarios for suspecting the diagnosis are: (1) positive newborn screening result, which to date is performed in more than half of the United States; (2) a male or female proband with suggestive clinical and laboratory findings; (3) a male not known to have X-ALD ascertained and diagnosed via family screening. The diagnosis is established by identification of a hemizygous ABCD1 pathogenic variant in a male or a heterozygous ABCD1 pathogenic variant in a female on molecular genetic testing.

GeneReviews those boys at risk to develop childhood CALD (cCALD) who will benefit from targeted therapy (either hematopoietic stem cell transplantation or, in some, an ex vivo gene therapy recently approved in the US). Supportive care: Older males with CALD and males and females with AMN require supportive treatment by multidisciplinary specialists in relevant fields to improve quality of life, maximize function, and reduce complications. For primary adrenocortical insufficiency, newborn males and asymptomatic infant boys with confirmed X-ALD require immediate referral to a pediatric endocrinologist to screen for adrenocortical insufficiency in order to either promptly treat those with confirmed adrenal insufficiency according to published steroid replacement guidelines or institute a plan for scheduled screening throughout childhood for boys who do not yet have adrenal insufficiency. Older males require scheduled screening to detect later-onset adrenal insufficiency. Surveillance: For boys receiving targeted therapy for neurologic disease, the treating neurologist / biochemical geneticist monitors existing manifestations, the individual's response to targeted therapy, and need for supportive care. Older males with CALD and males and females with AMN receiving supportive care require scheduled examinations by their multidisciplinary care providers to identify and address emerging issues. Boys at risk for cCALD who are possible candidates for targeted therapy require frequent assessments starting at age 12 months. For primary adrenocortical insufficiency, boys who do not yet have adrenal involvement require scheduled assessments by their treating pediatric endocrinologist throughout childhood. Males with AMN require scheduled assessment (at least yearly) by their treating endocrinologist. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Triggers known or suspected to be associated with activation of cerebral disease, including significant head injury, coma associated with adrenal crisis, and neurosurgical procedures. Evaluation of relatives at risk: It is appropriate to evaluate at-risk male relatives of an affected individual through measurement of plasma concentration of very long-chain fatty acids or molecular genetic testing if the familial ABCD1 pathogenic variant is known in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from screening for primary adrenocortical insufficiency and to facilitate timely identification of young males who might benefit from targeted treatment for cCALD. Genetic counseling X-ALD is inherited in an X-linked manner. Approximately 95% of probands inherit an ABCD1 pathogenic variant from one parent; at least 4% of individuals with X-ALD have a de novo pathogenic variant. If the mother of the proband has an ABCD1 pathogenic variant, the chance of the mother transmitting it in each pregnancy is 50%; if the father of the proband is affected (i.e., hemizygous for an ABCD1 pathogenic variant), he will transmit the pathogenic variant to all of his daughters and none of his sons. Males who inherit the pathogenic variant will be affected; females who inherit the pathogenic variant will typically be symptom-free in childhood but may manifest findings in adulthood. A positive newborn screening result in a female infant should prompt identification and evaluation of at-risk male relatives, as identification of males with X-ALD before symptoms occur or early in the course of the disease can allow for diagnosis and management of adrenal insufficiency before life-threatening complications occur; such testing can also allow for correct diagnosis of early (and often nonspecific) neurologic, behavioral, and/or cognitive signs and symptoms. Once the ABCD1 pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, heterozygote testing for at-risk female relatives and prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.

At least 95% of live-born individuals with CDPX2 are female. Characteristic features include growth deficiency; distinctive craniofacial appearance; chondrodysplasia punctata (stippling of the epiphyses of the long bones, vertebrae, trachea, and distal ends of the ribs); often asymmetric rhizomelic shortening of limbs; scoliosis; linear or blotchy scaling ichthyosis in the newborn; later appearance of linear or whorled atrophic patches involving hair follicles (follicular atrophoderma); coarse hair with scarring alopecia; and cataracts.

Women with an EBP germline pathogenic variant have a 50% chance of transmitting the pathogenic variant to each child: EBP pathogenic variants in sons are usually lethal; daughters will have a range of possible phenotypic expression. When the parents are clinically unaffected, the risk to the sibs of a proband appears to be low but greater than that of the general population. If the pathogenic variant cannot be detected in the DNA extracted from the leukocytes of either parent of the proband, three possible explanations are germline mosaicism, somatic mosaicism, or a de novo pathogenic variant in the proband. Prenatal diagnosis for pregnancies at increased risk is possible if the family-specific pathogenic variant is known."

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics X-linked lymphoproliferative disease (XLP) in general is characterized by an inappropriate immune response to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection leading to hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) or severe mononucleosis, dysgammaglobulinemia, and lymphoproliferative disease (malignant lymphoma). The condition primarily affects males. XLP has two recognizable subtypes, XLP1 (due to pathogenic variants in SH2D1A) and XLP2 (due to pathogenic variants in XIAP). HLH / fulminant infectious mononucleosis is the most common presentation regardless of subtype. HLH is characterized as an acute illness with prolonged and high fever, bi- or trilineage cytopenias, and hepatosplenomegaly, which is often severe or fatal. Death is generally secondary to liver failure or multisystem organ dysfunction. In those with XLP1, dys- or hypogammaglobulinemia can lead to varying degrees of humoral immune dysfunction associated with bronchiectasis and recurrent respiratory infections that, if untreated, may result in death. Lymphoproliferative disease (malignant lymphoma) and other lymphoproliferative diseases are specific to XLP1 and often develop in childhood, usually following EBV exposure. Rarer findings in those with XLP1 can include aplastic anemia, vasculitis, and lymphoid granulomatosis. Males with XLP2 are more likely to have HLH without EBV infection, recurrent episodes of HLH (which is not typically seen in those with XLP1), splenomegaly, and gastrointestinal disease, including enterocolitis and perirectal abscesses or fistulae. Rarely, individuals with XLP2 and inflammatory bowel disease have been reported to develop inflammatory liver disease, which can progress to fatal liver failure. Transient hypogammaglobulinemia has been rarely observed in those with XLP2. To date, neither lymphoproliferative disease nor common variable immunodeficiency has been reported in males with XLP2. Heterozygous females rarely have symptoms. There are, however, increasing numbers of reports of affected females with unfavorable (skewed) X-chromosome inactivation favoring the X chromosome with the pathogenic variant who develop HLH, inflammatory bowel disease, and erythema nodosum.

Diagnosis/testing GeneReviews The diagnosis of XLP1 or XLP2 can be established in a male proband who has a hemizygous germline pathogenic variant in SH2D1A (XLP1) or XIAP (XLP2) identified on molecular genetic testing. These males typically have low or absent SAP or XIAP protein expression, respectively, by flow cytometry. Female probands with a heterozygous pathogenic variant in SH2D1A or XIAP identified on molecular genetic testing and skewed X-chromosome inactivation toward expression of the chromosome with the pathogenic SH2DA1 or XIAP variant have been reported; such individuals may be symptomatic. Management Targeted therapy: The only known curative therapy for XLP1 is allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT), which should be strongly considered in all males as early in life as is feasible, particularly in those who have not developed symptoms; HSCT is not recommended for asymptomatic heterozygous females. For individuals with XLP2, many manifestations of disease can be improved with HSCT; however, there are more complications in these individuals. Supportive care: Standard treatment for liver dysfunction/failure, hypogammaglobulinemia (IVIG or IgG), fulminant EBV infection / HLH (including etoposide and steroids and consideration of rituximab), lymphoma, colitis, aplastic anemia, and vasculitis. Surveillance: At each visit, obtain history of any neurologic changes; physical exam for evidence of hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and neurologic changes; monitor for signs and symptoms of colitis and cholangitis in those with XLP2. Based on clinical status / evaluation for early evidence of HLH, monitor for liver dysfunction with hepatic profiles and coagulation; measurement of complete blood count; measurement of serum inflammatory markers (ferritin, soluble IL2R). As needed, measurement of serum IgG levels based on phenotype or in those with recurrent respiratory infections; EBV-PCR in blood for evidence of EBV infection if a person has symptoms of infection or HLH develops. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Individuals with XLP who come into contact with EBV are at risk of developing HLH and/or lymphoproliferation. Individuals are also at risk of developing HLH or inflammatory problems secondary to other infections. Evaluation of relatives at risk: Evaluation of apparently asymptomatic older and younger at-risk sibs and other maternal male relatives of an affected individual in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from medical management and consideration of presymptomatic bone marrow transplantation in males. Genetic counseling XLP is inherited in an X-linked manner. The risk to the sibs of a male proband depends on the genetic status of the mother: if the mother is heterozygous for an SH2D1A or XIAP pathogenic variant, the chance of transmitting the SH2D1A or XIAP pathogenic variant in each pregnancy is 50%. Male sibs who inherit the pathogenic variant will be affected; female sibs who inherit the pathogenic variant will be heterozygotes and will typically not be affected (in rare cases, heterozygous females may be symptomatic due to skewed X-chromosome inactivation). Genetic testing of at-risk female relatives is most informative if the pathogenic variant has been identified in the proband. Prenatal testing is possible for a pregnancy at increased risk if the familial pathogenic variant is known."

Clinical characteristics X-linked ocular albinism (XLOA) is a disorder of melanosome biogenesis leading to minor cutaneous and adnexal manifestations and congenital and persistent visual impairment in affected males. XLOA is characterized by infantile nystagmus, reduced visual acuity, hypopigmentation of the iris pigment epithelium and the ocular fundus, and foveal hypoplasia. Significant refractive errors, reduced or absent binocular functions, photoaversion, and strabismus are common. XLOA is a non-progressive disorder and the visual acuity remains stable throughout life, often slowly improving into the mid-teens. Diagnosis/testing A diagnosis of ocular albinism (OA) is probable in the presence of infantile nystagmus, iris translucency, substantial hypopigmentation of the ocular fundus periphery in males with mildly hypopigmented skin (most notably when compared to unaffected sibs), foveal hypoplasia, reduced visual acuity, and aberrant optic pathway projection as demonstrated by crossed asymmetry of the cortical responses on visual evoked potential testing. X- linked inheritance is documented by either a family history consistent with X-linked inheritance or the presence of typical carrier signs (irregular retinal pigmentation and mild iris transillumination) in an obligate carrier female. Molecular genetic testing of GPR143 (previously OA1) detects pathogenic variants in more than 90% of affected males.

Pregnancy management: The teratogenic risk to the fetus associated with the use of anti-seizure medication during pregnancy depends on the type of anti-seizure medication used, the dose, and the gestational age of the fetus. There are currently no guidelines regarding the most appropriate surveillance for and management of cardiac, vascular, and connective tissue problems during pregnancy. Genetic counseling FLNA deficiency is inherited in an X-linked manner. The condition is prenatally or neonatally lethal in most males; therefore, the majority of affected individuals are female. About 50% of affected females inherit the pathogenic variant from their mother and at least 50% have a de novo pathogenic variant. For women with FLNA deficiency, the risk of passing the pathogenic variant to each child is 50%. Because of the high rate of prenatal lethality in males, most sons born to women with FLNA deficiency are unaffected. Prenatal diagnosis by molecular genetic testing is possible once the pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member. Periventricular nodules may be visualized by imaging as early as 24 weeks' gestation; however, the sensitivity of imaging for the prenatal detection of PVNH is not known."

Typical X-SCID. Prior to universal newborn screening (NBS) for SCID most males with typical X-SCID came to medical attention between ages three and six months because of recurrent infections, persistent infections, and infections with opportunistic organisms. With universal NBS for SCID, the common presentation for typical X-SCID is now an asymptomatic, healthy-appearing male infant. Atypical X-SCID, which usually is not detected by NBS, can manifest in the first years of life or later with one of the following: recurrent upper and lower respiratory tract infections with bronchiectasis; Omenn syndrome, a clinical phenotype caused by immune dysregulation; X-SCID combined immunodeficiency (often with recurrent infections, warts, and dermatitis); immune dysregulation and autoimmunity; or Epstein-Barr virus-related lymphoproliferative complications.

Atypical X-SCID. Treatment depends on the degree of infectious complications and the presence of immune dysregulation and/or autoimmunity, and requires subspecialty immunologic care to assist in the diagnosis and choice of antimicrobial and immune-suppressive therapies. Surveillance: After successful HSCT, routine monitoring of affected males every six to 12 months regarding lineage-specific donor cell engraftment; growth, immune, and lung function; and any gastrointestinal and/or dermatologic issues. If HSCT involved conditioning chemotherapy, long-term monitoring of vital organ function and neurodevelopmental progress is also warranted. Agents/circumstances to avoid: To ensure the safety of affected individuals of all ages pending definitive treatment to achieve immunocompetence, parents and other care providers need to assure that the following are avoided: breast-feeding and breast milk (pending clarification of maternal CMV status); exposure to young children, sick persons, or individuals with cold sores; crowded enclosed spaces; live viral vaccines for the affected individual as well as household contacts; transfusion of non-irradiated blood products; areas of construction or soil manipulation. Evaluation of relatives at risk: When the IL2RG pathogenic variant causing X-SCID in the family is known, prenatal testing of at-risk male fetuses may be performed to help prepare for optimal management of an affected infant at birth. If prenatal testing has not been performed, an at-risk newborn male should immediately be placed in a safe environment and tested for the familial IL2RG pathogenic variant to allow earliest possible diagnosis and treatment. Genetic counseling X-SCID is inherited in an X-linked manner. The chance that a female who is heterozygous (i.e., a carrier) for the familial IL2RG pathogenic variant will transmit the variant in each pregnancy is 50%: males who inherit the pathogenic variant will be affected; females who inherit the pathogenic variant will be carriers and will be clinically asymptomatic. Affected males transmit the IL2RG pathogenic variant to all of their daughters and none of their sons. Once the IL2RG pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible."

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Individuals with X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism (XDP) have dystonia of varying severity and parkinsonism. XDP afflicts primarily Filipino men and, rarely, women. The mean age of onset in men is 39 years; the clinical course is highly variable with parkinsonism as the initial presenting sign, overshadowed by dystonia as the disease progresses. Features of parkinsonism include resting tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity, postural instability, and severe shuffling gait. The dystonia develops focally, most commonly in the jaw, neck, trunk, and eyes, and less commonly in the limbs, tongue, pharynx, and larynx, the most characteristic being jaw dystonia often progressing to neck dystonia. Individuals with pure parkinsonism have non-disabling symptoms that are only slowly progressive; those who develop a combination of parkinsonism and dystonia can develop multifocal or generalized symptoms within a few years and die prematurely from pneumonia or intercurrent infections. Female carriers are mostly asymptomatic, though a small minority may manifest dystonia, parkinsonism, or chorea. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of XDP is suspected in a male with typical clinical findings, family history consistent with X- linked inheritance, and maternal ancestral roots from the Panay Islands in the Philippines. Molecular genetic testing for variants that tag a disease-associated haplotype of the multilocus transcript system termed TAF/DYT3 is required to confirm the diagnosis in those with no known family history of XDP, very early symptoms, and/or a phenotype of pure parkinsonism, pure tremor, or chorea without dystonia. Olfactory testing indicates olfactory dysfunction early in the disease and may be used to support the diagnosis when molecular genetic testing is not available. Management Treatment of manifestations: Pharmacologic agents are used to treat dystonia or parkinsonism or both. Anticholinergic agents, benzodiazepines, and sometimes neuroleptics are used in the early stages of dystonia; Author Affiliation: 1 Director, Movement Disorders Center of Arizona Scottsdale, Arizona; Email: vevidente@movementdisorders.us.

GeneReviews zolpidem and tetrabenazine are used after dystonia becomes multifocal or generalized. Botulinum toxin injections improve focal dystonia but may worsen swallowing in individuals with preexisting dysphagia. Parkinsonism is treated with levodopa and dopamine agonists to control tremor. Bilateral pallidal deep brain stimulation may be used to treat advanced disease and medically refractory dystonia, although it may have less effect on parkinsonism. Prevention of secondary complications: Swallowing evaluation to guide diet modification and swallowing techniques to minimize risk of aspiration. Physical therapy, coupled with maximal medical and surgical therapy, may help delay immobility and its complications. Surveillance: Annual clinical evaluations in males with the disease-related haplotype who are not yet symptomatic, biannual evaluation for symptomatic males to monitor medications, and periodic swallowing evaluation, especially in those with subjective dysphagia. Genetic counseling XDP is inherited in an X-linked manner. Approximately 94% of affected individuals have a known family history of the condition. De novo occurrence of the disease-related haplotype associated with the disorder has not been observed to date. Males with XDP pass the TAF1/DYT3 disease-associated haplotype to all of their daughters and none of their sons. Women who are carriers have a 50% chance of transmitting the TAF1/DYT3 disease- associated haplotype in each pregnancy: males who inherit the TAF1/DYT3 disease-associated haplotype will be affected; females who inherit the TAF1/DYT3 disease-associated haplotype are mostly asymptomatic, although a small percentage may manifest symptoms. Carrier evaluation of at-risk female relatives is possible if the TAF1/ DYT3 disease-associated haplotype has been identified in the family. Once the TAF1/DYT3 disease-associated haplotype has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic diagnosis for XDP are possible. Caution should be exercised in interpreting the results of prenatal testing as the c.94C>T (p.Arg32Cys) variant that marks the disease haplotype has not been proven to be the molecular cause of XDP."

Binocular vision and color vision are normal and visual acuity is typically better than 6/12. An abnormal head posture is seen in approximately 15% of affected individuals. The eyes are structurally normal and electrophysiologic studies (e.g., visual evoked potential, electroretinogram) are normal. Affected females report slightly better visual acuity than affected males; however, no differences between males and females in the amplitude, frequency, and waveform of nystagmus are observed. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis is based on clinical findings (including, when possible, ocular motility recordings). Identification of a hemizygous (in a male proband) or heterozygous (in a female proband) pathogenic variant in FRMD7 by molecular genetic testing can establish the diagnosis if clinical features are inconclusive. Management Treatment of manifestations: Correction of refractive errors as early as possible. Prisms may be useful in those with binocular vision whose nystagmus is dampened by convergence. Memantine and gabapentin can improve visual acuity, intensity of nystagmus, and foveation. Surgical approaches include: the Anderson-Kestenbaum procedure (surgery of the extraocular muscles to shift the null zone to the primary position) in order to correct anomalous head posture and horizontal rectus tenotomy to improve the waveform of the nystagmus and visual function.

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) is characterized by recurrent bacterial infections in affected males in the first two years of life. Recurrent otitis is the most common infection prior to diagnosis. Conjunctivitis, sinopulmonary infections, diarrhea, and skin infections are also frequently seen. Approximately 60% of individuals with XLA are recognized as having immunodeficiency when they develop a severe, life-threatening infection such as pneumonia, empyema, meningitis, sepsis, cellulitis, or septic arthritis. S pneumoniae and H influenzae are the most common organisms found prior to diagnosis and may continue to cause sinusitis and otitis after diagnosis and the initiation of gammaglobulin substitution therapy. Severe, difficult-to-treat enteroviral infections (often manifesting as dermatomyositis or chronic meningoencephalitis) can be prevented by this treatment. The prognosis for individuals with XLA has improved markedly in the last 25 years as a result of earlier diagnosis, the development of preparations of gammaglobulin that allow normal concentrations of serum immunoglobulin G to be achieved, and more liberal use of antibiotics. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of XLA is established in a male proband with characteristic clinical and laboratory findings and a hemizygous BTK pathogenic variant identified by molecular genetic testing. The diagnosis of XLA can be established in a female proband with characteristic clinical and laboratory findings and a heterozygous pathogenic variant in BTK identified by molecular genetic testing. Females with a heterozygous pathogenic variant in BTK extremely rarely have clinical and laboratory findings of XLA. Management Targeted therapy: The mainstay of treatment is gammaglobulin substitution therapy (by weekly subcutaneous injection or intravenous infusion every two to four weeks) to prevent bacterial infections.

Surveillance: Complete blood count with differential and quantitative serum immunoglobulins at least annually; chest and sinus imaging as needed to assess for chronic lung and/or sinus disease. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Live viral vaccines, particularly oral polio vaccine. Evaluation of relatives at risk: Molecular genetic testing of at-risk male relatives as soon after birth as possible ensures that gammaglobulin substitution therapy is initiated as soon as possible in affected individuals and administration of live viral vaccines can be avoided. Genetic counseling By definition, XLA is inherited in an X-linked manner. The risk to sibs of a male proband depends on the genetic status of the mother: if the mother has a BTK pathogenic variant, the chance of transmitting the BTK pathogenic variant in each pregnancy is 50%.

Mitogen proliferation may be normal, but NK- and T-cell cytotoxicity can be impaired. Antigen-specific responses are usually decreased or absent. Total numbers of B cells are normal but there is a marked reduction of class- switched memory B cells. Defective oxidative burst of both neutrophils and macrophages has been reported. The range of clinical findings varies, even within the same family. More than 50% of males with HIGM1 develop symptoms by age one year, and more than 90% are symptomatic by age four years. HIGM1 usually presents in infancy with recurrent upper- and lower-respiratory tract bacterial infections, opportunistic infections including Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, and recurrent or protracted diarrhea that can be infectious or noninfectious and is associated with failure to thrive. Neutropenia is common; thrombocytopenia and anemia are less commonly seen. Autoimmune and/or inflammatory disorders (such as sclerosing cholangitis) as well as increased risk for neoplasms have been reported as medical complications of this disorder. Significant neurologic complications, often the result of a CNS infection, are seen in 5%-15% of affected males.

Affected males also exhibit a peculiar combination of recurrent sinopulmonary infections and atopy, findings that have not been observed in affected females. All males reported to date with the syndrome have moderate-to-severe intellectual disability; in contrast, a minority of heterozygous females have been reported to have mild intellectual disability, while the majority have no discernible health or learning issues and are considered clinically unaffected. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of int22h1/int22h2-mediated Xq28 duplication in a hemizygous male or a heterozygous female is established by detection of a 0.5-Mb duplication within the q28 region of the X chromosome extending between 154.1 Mb and 154.6 Mb in the reference genome (NCBI Build GRCh37/hg19).

Surveillance: Measurement of growth parameters and assessment of neurodevelopmental progress, cognitive abilities, behavioral/psychiatric symptoms, and motor functioning at each visit; reassessment of special education needs annually in childhood and adolescence; routine follow up with orthopedist for those with contractures and/or kyphoscoliosis; pulmonary function testing as clinically indicated for those with severe asthma; at least annual audiologic and ophthalmologic evaluations. Evaluation of relatives at risk: Clinically asymptomatic sibs of affected individuals who also have the duplication should be regularly assessed and carefully monitored for achievement of neurodevelopmental milestones with the goal of instituting early intervention if or when neurodevelopmental delays are noted. Genetic counseling The int22h1/int22h2-mediated Xq28 duplication syndrome is inherited in an X-linked manner. Most affected individuals inherited the duplication from their heterozygous and often asymptomatic mother. However, individuals with de novo duplications have also been identified. Because offspring inherit one X chromosome from the mother, each child of a mother with an int22h1/int22h2-mediated Xq28 duplication has a 50% chance of inheriting the duplication. In other words, a female with an int22h1/int22h2-mediated Xq28 duplication has a 50% chance of passing the duplication to her offspring at each conception. Being hemizygous for X-linked genes, males who inherit the duplication are affected. In contrast, females who inherit the duplication will be heterozygous and thus, will either exhibit a milder phenotype or be clinically unaffected. Females in whom the X-inactivation pattern is skewed toward inactivation of the X chromosome bearing the duplication are more likely to be clinically unaffected. Once an int22h1/int22h2-mediated Xq28 duplication has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible."

Males with Y chromosome infertility usually have no obvious symptoms, although physical examination may reveal small testes. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of Y chromosome infertility is established in a male with characteristic clinical and laboratory features and by identification of a hemizygous deletion of Yq involving the AZF regions or identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant involving USP9Y (located within AZFa). Management Treatment of manifestations: Pregnancies may be achieved by in vitro fertilization using intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), an in vitro fertilization procedure in which spermatozoa retrieved from ejaculate (in males with oligozoospermia) or extracted from testicular biopsies (in males with azoospermia) are injected into an egg harvested from the reproductive partner. Other: Testicular sperm retrieval for in vitro fertilization is ineffective for males with AZFb and AZFa deletions, but has been successful for most males with AZFc deletions; in males with retrievable spermatozoa, the presence or absence of deletion of the long arm of the Y chromosome has no apparent effect on the fertilization or pregnancy rates; the risk for birth defects is the same as for any infertile couple that achieves a pregnancy using assisted reproductive technology.

Genetic counseling GeneReviews Y chromosome infertility is inherited in a Y-linked manner. Because males with Y chromosome deletions are infertile, the deletions are usually de novo and therefore not present in the father of the proband. Despite their severely impaired spermatogenesis, some males with deletion of the AZF regions have occasionally spontaneously fathered sons, who are infertile. This will occur in about 4% of couples with severe oligospermia if the female partner is young and very fertile. In pregnancies achieved using ICSI, male offspring have the same deletion as their father, with a high risk of male infertility. Note that certain Y deletions, including the most common Y deletions (gr/gr), do not necessarily cause infertility, but are only a risk factor for infertility. Female fetuses from a father with a Y chromosome deletion have no increased risk of congenital abnormalities or infertility. In pregnancies conceived through assisted reproductive technology (ART) and known to be at risk of resulting in a male with Y chromosome deletion, specific prenatal testing or preimplantation testing could be performed to determine the sex of the fetus and/or the presence of the Y chromosome deletion."

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (CPT1A) deficiency is a disorder of long-chain fatty acid oxidation. Clinical manifestations usually occur in an individual with a concurrent febrile or gastrointestinal illness when energy demands are increased; onset of symptoms is usually rapid. The recognized phenotypes are: acute fatty liver of pregnancy, in which the fetus has biallelic pathogenic variants in CPT1A that causes CPT1A deficiency; and hepatic encephalopathy, in which individuals (typically children) present with hypoketotic hypoglycemia and sudden onset of liver failure. Individuals with hepatic encephalopathy typically present with hypoglycemia, absent or low levels of ketones, and elevated serum concentrations of liver transaminases, ammonia, and total carnitine. Between episodes of hepatic encephalopathy, individuals appear developmentally and cognitively normal unless previous metabolic decompensation has resulted in neurologic damage. The diagnosis of CPT1A is established in a proband by the detection of biallelic pathogenic variants in CPT1A on molecular genetic testing or diminished carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT 1) enzyme activity on cultured skin fibroblasts when molecular genetic testing is not definitive. Residual enzyme activity is 1%-5% in most individuals with CPT1A deficiency. Management Treatment of manifestations: Prompt treatment of hypoglycemia with intravenous fluid containing 10% dextrose; the dextrose infusion should be maintained past the time that the blood glucose concentration has normalized in order to replete hepatic glycogen stores. Affected individuals, parents/guardians, and health care providers need to have readily available emergency treatment protocols for catastrophic metabolic crises.

GeneReviews Prevention of primary manifestations: To prevent hypoglycemia, infants should eat frequently during the day and have cornstarch continuously at night; fasting should not last more than 12 hours during illness, surgery, or medical procedures; adults need a high-carbohydrate, low-fat diet to provide a constant supply of carbohydrate energy and medium-chain triglycerides to provide approximately one third of total calories (C6-C10 fatty acids do not require the carnitine shuttle for entry into the mitochondrion). Prevention of secondary complications: Prevention of hypoglycemia reduces the risk for related neurologic damage. Surveillance: Individuals with CPT1A deficiency should have testing of liver enzymes (AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase) and liver function (including PT and PTT) at clinic appointments, even when asymptomatic, and during periods of reduced caloric intake and febrile illness. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Prolonged fasting; potentially hepatotoxic agents such as valproate and salicylate. Evaluation of relatives at risk: Regardless of age, each sib of a proband should be evaluated for CPT1A deficiency by either molecular genetic testing (if both pathogenic variants have been identified in the proband) or by enzyme analysis in cultured skin fibroblasts. Pregnancy management: Heterozygous pregnant women should be monitored for acute fatty liver of pregnancy. Genetic counseling CPT1A deficiency is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Heterozygotes (carriers) are asymptomatic, although heterozygous pregnant women may be at risk of developing acute fatty liver of pregnancy if the fetus has CPT1A deficiency. At conception, each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Carrier testing for at-risk family members and prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk are possible by biochemical testing if the enzyme defect has been confirmed in an affected family member or by molecular genetic testing if both pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member."

Clinical characteristics Optic atrophy type 1 (OPA1, or Kjer type optic atrophy) is characterized by bilateral and symmetric optic nerve pallor associated with insidious decrease in visual acuity (usually between ages 4 and 6 years), visual field defects, and color vision defects. Visual impairment is usually moderate (6/10 to 2/10), but ranges from mild or even insignificant to severe (legal blindness with acuity <1/20). The visual field defect is typically centrocecal, central, or paracentral; it is often large in those with severe disease. The color vision defect is often described as acquired blue-yellow loss (tritanopia). Other findings can include auditory neuropathy resulting in sensorineural hearing loss that ranges from severe and congenital to subclinical (i.e., identified by specific audiologic testing only). Visual evoked potentials are typically absent or delayed; pattern electroretinogram shows an abnormal N95:P50 ratio. Tritanopia is the classic feature of color vision defect, but more diffuse nonspecific dyschromatopsia is not uncommon. Ophthalmoscopic examination discloses temporal or diffuse pallor of the optic discs, sometimes associated with optic disc excavation. The neuroretinal rim shows some pallor in most cases, sometimes associated with a temporal pigmentary gray crescent. The diagnosis of OPA1 is made based on a combination of clinical findings, electrophysiologic studies, and family history and/or by the identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in OPA1, the only gene known to be associated with OPA1, by molecular genetic testing.

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Von Willebrand disease (VWD), a congenital bleeding disorder caused by deficient or defective plasma von Willebrand factor (VWF), may only become apparent on hemostatic challenge, and bleeding history may become more apparent with increasing age. Recent guidelines on VWD have recommended taking a VWF level of 30 or 40 IU/dL as a cutoff for those diagnosed with the disorder. Individuals with VWF levels greater than 30 IU/dL and lower than 50 IU/dL can be described as having a risk factor for bleeding. This change in guidelines significantly alters the proportion of individuals with each disease type. Type 1 VWD (~30% of VWD) typically manifests as mild mucocutaneous bleeding. Type 2 VWD accounts for approximately 60% of VWD. Type 2 subtypes include: Type 2A, which usually manifests as mild-to-moderate mucocutaneous bleeding; Type 2B, which typically manifests as mild-to-moderate mucocutaneous bleeding that can include thrombocytopenia that worsens in certain circumstances; Type 2M, which typically manifests as mild-moderate mucocutaneous bleeding; Type 2N, which can manifest as excessive bleeding with surgery and mimics mild hemophilia A. Type 3 VWD (<10% of VWD) manifests with severe mucocutaneous and musculoskeletal bleeding. The diagnosis of VWD typically requires characteristic results of assays of hemostasis factors specific for VWD and/or identification of a heterozygous, homozygous, or compound heterozygous pathogenic variant(s) in VWF by molecular genetic testing. In addition, the diagnosis requires (in most cases) a positive family history.

GeneReviews with a risk factor for bleeding (VWF levels >30 and <50 IU/dL), family history may not be positive because of incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity. Management Treatment of manifestations: Affected individuals benefit from care in a comprehensive bleeding disorders program. The two main treatments are desmopressin (1-deamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin [DDAVP]) and clotting factor concentrates (recombinant and plasma-derived) containing both VWF and FVIII (VWF/FVIII concentrate). Indirect hemostatic treatments that can reduce symptoms include fibrinolytic inhibitors; hormones for menorrhagia are also beneficial. Individuals with VWD should receive prompt treatment for severe bleeding episodes. Pregnant women with VWD are at increased risk for bleeding complications at or following childbirth. Prevention of primary manifestations: Prophylactic infusions of VWF/FVIII concentrates in individuals with type 3 VWD to prevent musculoskeletal bleeding and subsequent joint damage. Prevention of secondary complications: Cautious use of desmopressin (particularly in those age <2 years because of the potential difficulty in restricting fluids in this age group). Vaccination for hepatitis A and B. Surveillance: Follow up in centers experienced in the management of bleeding disorders. Periodic evaluation by a physiotherapist of those with type 3 VWD to monitor joint mobility. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Activities involving a high risk of trauma, particularly head injury; medications with effects on platelet function (ASA, clopidogrel, or NSAIDS). Circumcision in infant males should only be considered following consultation with a hematologist. Evaluation of relatives at risk: If the familial pathogenic variant(s) are known, molecular genetic testing for at- risk relatives to allow early diagnosis and treatment, if needed. Pregnancy management: As VWF levels increase throughout pregnancy, women with baseline VWF and FVIII levels greater than 30 IU/dL are likely to achieve normal levels by the time of delivery. However, those with a basal level lower than 20 IU/dL and those with baseline VWF:RCo or other VWF activity measurement/ VWF:Ag ratio <0.6 are likely to require replacement therapy. Desmopressin has been successfully used to cover delivery in women with type 1 VWD and a proportion of pregnant women with type 2 VWD; delayed, secondary postpartum bleeding may be a problem. Genetic counseling VWD types 2B and 2M are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. VWD types 1 and 2A are typically inherited in an autosomal dominant manner but may also be inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. VWD types 2N and 3 are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. AD inheritance. Most affected individuals have an affected parent. The proportion of cases caused by de novo pathogenic variants is unknown. Each child of an individual with AD VWD has a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant. AR inheritance. At conception, each sib of an individual with AR VWD has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Carrier testing for family members at risk for AR VWD is possible once the pathogenic variants have been identified in the family.

Onset ranges from birth to adulthood. Individuals can present in childhood with motor delays and gait instability. Cognitive impairment ranging from mild intellectual disability to developmental delay has been reported, and several individuals have normal cognitive function. Individuals have also presented as young adults with gait difficulties caused by spastic ataxia or ataxia. In addition to gait ataxia, affected individuals had limb ataxia, dysarthria, and eye movement abnormalities (macro-saccadic oscillations, nystagmus, and saccadic pursuit). Additional features reported in some individuals include peripheral neuropathy and/or seizures. The disorder progresses to spastic ataxia or generalized dystonia, which can lead to loss of independent ambulation. The diagnosis of VPS13D movement disorder is established in a proband by identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in VPS13D on molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Standard treatment for seizures; spasticity treatments include baclofen, tizanidine, benzodiazepines, dantrolene sodium, gabapentin, botulinum toxin injections, and intrathecal baclofen; treatment options for dystonia include trihexyphenidyl, botulinum toxin injections, benzodiazepines, baclofen, and levodopa.

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics GNAO1-related disorder encompasses a broad phenotypic continuum that includes hyperkinetic movement disorders and/or epilepsy and is typically associated with developmental delay and intellectual disability. Viewed by age of onset, three clusters in this continuum can be observed: (1) infantile-onset developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE) with or without prominent movement disorder; (2) infantile- or early childhood-onset prominent movement disorder and neurodevelopmental disorder with or without childhood-onset epilepsy with varying seizure types; (3) later childhood- or adult-onset movement disorder with variable developmental delay and intellectual disability. Epilepsy can be either DEE (onset typically within the first year of life of drug-resistant epilepsy in which developmental delays are attributed to the underlying diagnosis as well as the impact of uncontrolled seizures) or varying seizure types (onset typically between ages three and ten years of focal or generalized tonic-clonic seizures that may be infrequent or well controlled with anti-seizure medications). Movement disorders are characterized by dystonia and choreoathetosis, most commonly a mixed pattern of persistent or paroxysmal dyskinesia that affects the whole body. Exacerbations of the hyperkinetic movement disorder, which can be spontaneous or triggered (e.g., by intercurrent illness, emotional stress, voluntary movements), can last minutes to weeks. Hyperkinetic crises (including status dystonicus) are characterized by temporarily increased and nearly continuous involuntary movements or dystonic posturing that can be life- threatening.

GeneReviews Deaths in early childhood have been reported due to medically refractory epilepsy or hyperkinetic crises, but the phenotypic spectrum includes milder presentations, including in adults. As many adults with disabilities have not undergone advanced genetic testing, it is likely that adults with GNAO1-related disorder are underrecognized and underreported. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of GNAO1-related disorder is established in a proband with suggestive findings and a heterozygous pathogenic variant in GNAO1 identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: There is no cure for GNAO1-related disorder. Supportive care to improve quality of life, maximize function, and reduce complications can include multidisciplinary care by specialists in child neurology, adult neurology, neurosurgery, physical medicine and rehabilitation, physical therapy, occupational therapy, orthopedic surgery, speech-language therapy, and psychology. Surveillance: Frequent evaluations by treating specialists are necessary to monitor existing manifestations, the individual's response to supportive care, and the emergence of new manifestations. Genetic counseling GNAO1-related disorder is an autosomal dominant disorder most often caused by a de novo pathogenic variant. Individuals with severe GNAO1-related disorder phenotypes (i.e., DEE, severe developmental delay and/or intellectual disability, and/or an early-onset movement disorder) typically represent simplex cases (i.e., the only family member known to be affected) and have the disorder as the result of a de novo pathogenic variant; however, recurrence of severe GNAO1-related disorder phenotypes in affected sibs due to presumed parental germline mosaicism has been reported. Vertical transmission from an affected parent to an affected child has been reported in several families with the milder phenotype (i.e., later childhood- or adult-onset movement disorder with variable developmental delay and intellectual disability). Once the GNAO1 pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing are possible."

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is characterized by severe hypotonia, poor appetite, and feeding difficulties in early infancy, followed in early childhood by excessive eating and gradual development of morbid obesity (unless food intake is strictly controlled). Motor milestones and language development are delayed. All individuals have some degree of cognitive impairment. Hypogonadism is present in both males and females and manifests as genital hypoplasia, incomplete pubertal development, and, in most, infertility. Short stature is common (if not treated with growth hormone). A distinctive behavioral phenotype (temper tantrums, stubbornness, manipulative behavior, and obsessive-compulsive characteristics) is common. Characteristic facial features, strabismus, and scoliosis are often present. Diagnosis/testing PWS is a contiguous gene syndrome due to abnormal DNA methylation within the Prader-Willi critical region (PWCR) at 15q11.2-q13. The diagnosis and molecular cause can be identified in a proband by simultaneous DNA methylation analysis and oligo-SNP combination array (OSA). DNA methylation analysis identifies maternal-only imprinting within the PWCR. OSA can identify the molecular cause in those with a 15q11.2-q13 deletion, imprinting center deletion, and uniparental isodisomy and segmental isodisomy. In individuals with maternal-only imprinting identified on DNA methylation analysis and a normal OSA, DNA polymorphism analysis can be used to distinguish uniparental heterodisomy from an imprinting defect by epimutation.

Assess for new seizures or monitor those with seizures at each visit. Dental evaluations every six months or more frequently in those with dental issues. Genetic counseling Individuals with PWS typically represent simplex cases (i.e., a single affected family member) and have the disorder as the result of a de novo genetic alteration. The vast majority of families have a recurrence risk of less than 1%. However, certain etiologies involve a recurrence risk as high as 50%, and a scenario with a risk of almost 100%, though very unlikely, is theoretically possible. Reliable PWS recurrence risk assessment therefore requires identification of the genetic mechanism of PWS in the proband (i.e., a 15q deletion, UPD 15, or an imprinting defect) and parental testing to discern the presence of a predisposing genetic alternation (e.g., a parental chromosome rearrangement or paternal heterozygosity for an imprinting center deletion). Once the causative genetic mechanism has been identified in the proband, prenatal testing for PWS is possible."

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Familial hemiplegic migraine (FHM) falls within the category of migraine with aura. In migraine with aura (including FHM) the neurologic symptoms of aura are unequivocally localizable to the cerebral cortex or brain stem and include visual disturbance (most common), sensory loss (e.g., numbness or paresthesias of the face or an extremity), and dysphasia (difficulty with speech). FHM must include motor involvement, such as hemiparesis (weakness of an extremity). Hemiparesis occurs with at least one other symptom during FHM aura. Neurologic deficits with FHM attacks can be prolonged for hours to days and may outlast the associated migrainous headache. FHM is often earlier in onset than typical migraine, frequently beginning in the first or second decade; the frequency of attacks tends to decrease with age. Approximately 40%-50% of families with CACNA1A-FHM have cerebellar signs ranging from nystagmus to progressive, usually late-onset mild ataxia. Diagnosis/testing The clinical diagnosis of FHM can be established in a proband: (1) who fulfills criteria for migraine with aura; (2) in whom the aura includes fully reversible motor weakness and visual, sensory, or language symptoms; and (3) who has at least one first- or second-degree relative with similar attacks that fulfill the diagnostic criteria for hemiplegic migraine. The molecular diagnosis can be established in a proband by identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in ATP1A2, CACNA1A, PRRT2, or SCN1A. Management Treatment of manifestations: A trial of acetazolamide for individuals with CACNA1A-FHM or a trial of prophylactic migraine medications (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, anti- seizure medications) for all FHM types may be warranted for frequent attacks.

Xanthomas (cholesterol deposits in tendons) may be visible in the Achilles tendons or tendons of the hands and worsen with age as a result of extremely high cholesterol levels. Xanthelasmas (yellowish, waxy deposits) can occur around the eyelids. Individuals with FH may develop corneal arcus (white, gray, or blue opaque ring in the corneal margin as a result of cholesterol deposition) at a younger age than those without FH. Individuals with a more severe phenotype, often as a result of biallelic variants, can present with very significant elevations in LDL-C (>500 mg/dL), early-onset coronary artery disease (CAD; presenting as early as childhood in some), and calcific aortic valve disease. Diagnosis/testing A clinical diagnosis of FH can be established in a proband with characteristic clinical features and significantly elevated LDL-C levels (typically >190 mg/dL in adults and >160 mg/dL in children). Three formal diagnostic criteria are used in Western countries. The molecular diagnosis of FH can be established by identification of heterozygous or biallelic pathogenic variants in APOB (variants that impair binding of LDL-C to the LDL receptor), LDLR, or PCSK9 (gain of function); or rarely, identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in LDLRAP1.

Management GeneReviews Treatment of manifestations: Adults: pharmacotherapy (statins with additional medications as needed) to reduce lipid levels; referral to a lipid specialist if necessary to reduce LDL-C levels; reduce CAD risk factors including cessation of smoking, regular physical activity, healthy diet, and weight control; treatment of hypertension; low- dose aspirin in high-risk individuals. Children: referral to a lipid specialist; diet and lifestyle modifications; statins can be used in children starting around age eight years. Prevention of primary manifestations: Heart-healthy diet (including reduced intake of saturated fat and increased intake of soluble fiber to 10-20 g/day); increased physical activity; no smoking. Surveillance: Monitor lipid levels from age two years; consider noninvasive imaging modalities in adults; identify modifiable risk factors (e.g., smoking, sedentary behavior, hypertension, diabetes, obesity). Individuals with severe FH (i.e., due to homozygous or compound heterozygous pathogenic variants in APOB, LDLR, or PCSK9) or autosomal recessive FH (due to homozygous or compound heterozygous pathogenic variants in LDLRAP1) should be monitored with various imaging modalities (including echocardiogram, CT angiogram, and cardiac catheterization) as recommended. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Smoking, high intake of saturated and trans unsaturated fat, sedentary lifestyle, obesity, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. Evaluation of relatives at risk: Early diagnosis and treatment of first-degree and second-degree relatives at risk for FH can reduce morbidity and mortality. The genetic status of at-risk family members can be clarified by either: (1) molecular genetic testing if the pathogenic variant(s) has been identified in an affected family member; or (2) measurement of LDL-C concentration. Genetic testing is the preferred method for clarifying the diagnosis in at- risk family members, when possible. Pregnancy management: Pregnant women should incorporate all the recommended lifestyle changes, including low saturated fat intake, no smoking, and high dietary soluble fiber. Statins are contraindicated in pregnancy because of concerns for teratogenicity and should be discontinued prior to conception. Bile acid-binding resins (e.g., colesevelam) are generally considered safe (Class B for pregnancy), and LDL apheresis is also used occasionally if there is evidence of established CAD. Use of PCSK9 inhibitors, ezetimibe, lomitapide, and bempedoic acid during pregnancy has not been well studied. Genetic counseling APOB-, LDLR-, and PCSK9-related FH are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. If an individual has biallelic (homozygous or compound heterozygous) pathogenic variants in one of these three genes a condition referred to as homozygous FH (HoFH) the presentation becomes more severe with earlier onset of features. Some individuals with FH are heterozygous for pathogenic variants in two different FH-related genes, which may have an additive effect on the severity of FH. Each child of an individual with a heterozygous pathogenic variant in APOB, LDLR, or PCSK9 has a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant and having FH. All children of an individual with homozygous FH will inherit a pathogenic variant and have FH. If the reproductive partner of a proband is heterozygous for an FH-related pathogenic variant in the same gene as the proband or a different FH-related gene, offspring are at risk of inheriting two pathogenic variants and having severe FH. LDLRAP1-related FH is caused by biallelic pathogenic variants and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. The parents of an individual with LDLRAP1-related FH are presumed to be heterozygous for one pathogenic variant. If both parents are known to be heterozygous for an LDLRAP1 pathogenic variant, each sib of an affected individual has at conception a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being a carrier, and a 25% chance of inheriting neither of the familial pathogenic variants. Carrier testing for at-risk relatives requires prior identification of the LDLRAP1 pathogenic variants in the family. Hypercholesterolemia 3 Once the FH-causing pathogenic variant(s) have been identified in an affected family member, prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing are possible."

CS is a multiple hamartoma syndrome with a high risk for benign and malignant tumors of the thyroid, breast, kidney, and endometrium. Affected individuals usually have macrocephaly, trichilemmomas, and papillomatous papules, and present by the late 20s. The lifetime risk of developing breast cancer is 85%, with an average age of diagnosis between 38 and 46 years. The lifetime risk for thyroid cancer (usually follicular, rarely papillary, but never medullary thyroid cancer) is approximately 35%. The lifetime risk for renal cell cancer (predominantly of papillary histology) is 34%. The risk for endometrial cancer may approach 28%. BRRS is a congenital disorder characterized by macrocephaly, intestinal hamartomatous polyposis, lipomas, and pigmented macules of the glans penis. PS is a complex, highly variable disorder involving congenital malformations and hamartomatous overgrowth of multiple tissues, as well as connective tissue nevi, epidermal nevi, and hyperostoses. Proteus-like syndrome is undefined but refers to individuals with significant clinical features of PS who do not meet the diagnostic criteria for PS. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of PHTS is established in a proband by identification of a heterozygous germline PTEN pathogenic variant on molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Treatment for the benign and malignant manifestations of PHTS is the same as for their sporadic counterparts.

GeneReviews alleviate the mucocutaneous manifestations of CS but are rarely utilized; cutaneous lesions should be excised only if malignancy is suspected or symptoms (e.g., pain, deformity, increased scarring) are significant. Surveillance: To detect tumors at the earliest, most treatable stages: Children (age <18 years). Yearly thyroid ultrasound from the time of diagnosis (earliest reported at age 7 years) and skin check with physical examination Adults. Yearly thyroid ultrasound and dermatologic evaluation Women beginning at age 30 years. Monthly breast self-examination; annual breast screening (at minimum mammogram; MRI may also be incorporated). Starting by age 35 years, consider transvaginal ultrasound or endometrial biopsy. Men and women. Colonoscopy beginning at age 35 years with frequency dependent on degree of polyposis identified or family history of early-onset colon cancer (before age 40); biennial (every 2 years) renal imaging (CT or MRI preferred) beginning at age 40 years Those with a family history of a particular cancer type at an early age. Consider initiating screening 5 to 10 years prior to the youngest age of diagnosis in the family. Evaluation of relatives at risk: When a PTEN pathogenic variant has been identified in a proband, molecular genetic testing of asymptomatic at-risk relatives can identify those who have the family-specific pathogenic variant and warrant ongoing surveillance. Genetic counseling PHTS is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Because CS is likely underdiagnosed, the actual proportion of simplex cases (defined as individuals with no obvious family history) and familial cases (defined as 2 related affected individuals) cannot be determined. The majority of CS cases are simplex. Perhaps 10%-50% of individuals with CS have an affected parent. Each child of an affected individual has a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant and developing PHTS. Once a PTEN pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk is possible."

The age of onset ranges from 19 to 73 years; mean age of onset is between 43 and 52 years. Initial symptoms are gait unsteadiness, stumbling, and imbalance (in ~90%) and dysarthria (in ~10%). Eventually all persons have gait ataxia, upper-limb incoordination, intention tremor, and dysarthria. Dysphagia and choking are common. Visual disturbances may result from diplopia, difficulty fixating on moving objects, horizontal gaze-evoked nystagmus, and vertical nystagmus. Hyperreflexia and extensor plantar responses occur in up to 40%-50%. Basal ganglia signs, including dystonia and blepharospasm, occur in up to 25%. Mentation is generally preserved. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of SCA6 rests on the use of molecular genetic testing to detect an abnormal CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in CACNA1A. Affected individuals have 20 to 33 CAG repeats. Management Treatment of manifestations: Acetazolamide may eliminate episodes of ataxia; canes, walking sticks, and walkers to prevent falling; home modifications for safety and convenience; weighted eating utensils and dressing hooks; physical therapy and exercises enhancing balance and core strength; vitamin supplements particularly if caloric intake is reduced; feeding recommendations as per feeding therapist / occupational therapist; weight control, as obesity exacerbates ambulation and mobility problems; vestibular symptoms may be managed with medications including diphenhydramine, baclofen, and gabapentin. 4-aminopyridine may be helpful with vestibular symptoms and to suppress nystagmus; refractive or surgical management per ophthalmologist for diplopia; speech therapy and communication devices for dysarthria; clonazepam for REM sleep disorders; continuous positive airway pressure for sleep apnea.

Approximately 25% of affected individuals have neurologic manifestations (acquired microcephaly, diminished or absent deep tendon stretch reflexes, progressive sensorineural hearing loss, progressive cognitive impairment, and ataxia). The most common causes of death are skin cancer, neurologic degeneration, and internal cancer. The median age at death in persons with XP with neurodegeneration (29 years) was found to be younger than that in persons with XP without neurodegeneration (37 years). Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of XP is established in a proband on the basis of clinical findings and family history and/or by the identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in DDB2, ERCC1, ERCC2, ERCC3, ERCC4, ERCC5, POLH, XPA, or XPC. Management Treatment of manifestations: Premalignant skin lesions such as actinic keratoses can be treated by freezing with liquid nitrogen; larger areas can be treated with field treatments such as topical 5-fluorouracil or imiquimod preparations.

Oral isotretinoin or acitretin can prevent new skin neoplasms but have many side effects. Neoplasms of the eyelids, conjunctiva, and cornea can be treated surgically; corneal injury associated with eyelid abnormality can be decreased with eye drops or soft contact lenses; corneal transplantation may improve the visual impairment resulting from severe keratitis. Hearing loss may be treated with hearing aids. Prevention of primary manifestations: Avoid sun and other UV exposure to the skin and eyes. Measure UV light with a light meter in an affected individual's home, school, and/or work environment so that high levels of environmental UV can be identified and eliminated. Surveillance: Skin examinations by a physician every three to 12 months; eye exams for signs of UV exposure and damage every six months; routine eye and neurologic examinations for progressive neurologic abnormalities every 12 months; audiograms every six to12 months. Agents/circumstances to avoid: UV exposure from sunlight and artificial sources of UV radiation; cigarette smoke. Evaluation of relatives at risk: If family-specific pathogenic variants have been identified, molecular genetic testing of at-risk sibs can permit early diagnosis and rigorous sun protection from an early age. Pregnancy management: Systemic retinoids (isotretinoin, acitretin) may be used as skin cancer chemopreventive agents. These drugs are known to be teratogenic to a developing fetus and pose a high risk for birth defects. Women of reproductive age who are taking a systemic retinoid must use effective contraception and be monitored with regular pregnancy tests.

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Nonsyndromic 46,XX testicular disorders/differences of sex development (DSD) are characterized by: the presence of a 46,XX karyotype; external genitalia ranging from typical male to ambiguous; two testicles; azoospermia; absence of mllerian structures; and absence of other syndromic features, such as congenital anomalies outside of the genitourinary system, learning disorders / cognitive impairment, or behavioral issues. Approximately 85% of individuals with nonsyndromic 46,XX testicular DSD present after puberty with normal pubic hair and normal penile size but small testes, gynecomastia, and sterility resulting from azoospermia. Approximately 15% of individuals with nonsyndromic 46,XX testicular DSD present at birth with ambiguous genitalia. Gender role and gender identity are reported as male. If untreated, males with 46,XX testicular DSD experience the consequences of testosterone deficiency. Diagnosis/testing Diagnosis of nonsyndromic 46,XX testicular DSD is based on the combination of clinical findings, endocrine testing, and cytogenetic testing. Endocrine studies usually show hypergonadotropic hypogonadism secondary to testicular failure. Cytogenetic studies at the 550-band level demonstrate a 46,XX karyotype. SRY, the gene that encodes the sex-determining region Y protein, is the principal gene known to be associated with 46,XX testicular DSD. Approximately 80% of individuals with nonsyndromic 46,XX testicular DSD are SRY positive, as shown by use of FISH or chromosomal microarray. Other causes in SRY-negative individuals include small copy number variants (CNVs) in or around SOX3 or SOX9 and specific heterozygous pathogenic variants in NR5A1 or WT1.

Management GeneReviews Treatment of manifestations: Similar to that for other causes of testosterone deficiency. After age 14 years, low- dose testosterone therapy is initiated and gradually increased to reach adult levels. In affected individuals with short stature who are eligible for growth hormone therapy, testosterone therapy is either delayed or given at lower doses initially in order to maximize growth potential. Reduction mammoplasty may be considered if gynecomastia remains an issue following testosterone replacement therapy. Standard treatment for osteopenia, hypospadias, and cryptorchidism. Providers are encouraged to anticipate the need for further psychological support. Surveillance: Measurement of length/height at each visit. Assessment of mood, libido, energy, erectile function, acne, breast tenderness, and presence or progression of gynecomastia at each visit in adolescence and adulthood. For those on testosterone replacement therapy: measurement of serum testosterone levels every three months (just prior to the next injection) until testosterone dose is optimized; then annual measurement of serum testosterone levels, lipid profile, and liver function tests. Measurement of hematocrit at three, six, and 12 months after initiation of testosterone therapy, then annually thereafter. Digital rectal examination and measurement of serum prostate-specific antigen at three, six, and 12 months after initiation of testosterone therapy in adults, then annually thereafter. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry scan every three to five years after puberty or annually, if osteopenia has been identified. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Contraindications to testosterone replacement therapy include prostate cancer (known or suspected) and breast cancer; oral androgens such as methyltestosterone and fluoxymesterone should not be given because of liver toxicity. Genetic counseling The mode of inheritance and recurrence risk to sibs of a proband with a nonsyndromic 46,XX testicular DSD depend on the molecular diagnosis in the proband and the genetic status of the parents. SRY-positive 46,XX testicular DSD is generally not inherited because it results from de novo abnormal interchange between the Y chromosome and the X chromosome, resulting in the presence of SRY on the X chromosome and infertility. In the rare cases when SRY is translocated to another chromosome or when fertility is preserved, sex-limited autosomal dominant inheritance is observed. Pathogenic variants in NR5A1 are inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion, with reduced penetrance and variable expressivity. If a fertile parent is heterozygous, they will pass the variant to 50% of their offspring; offspring who are XX are at risk for testicular or ovotesticular DSD. To date, all known individuals with CNVs in or around SOX3 whose parents have undergone molecular genetic testing have the disorder as a result of a de novo pathogenic variant. In this scenario, the risk to sibs is low. Autosomal dominant inheritance has been documented for familial cases thought to be caused by CNVs in or around SOX9. However, only those with a 46,XX karyotype will be affected. To date, all known individuals with a pathogenic WT1 variant that causes nonsyndromic 46,XX testicular DSD whose parents have undergone molecular genetic testing have the disorder as a result of a de novo pathogenic variant. In this scenario, the risk to sibs is low."

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is a primary immunodeficiency disorder of phagocytes (neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, and eosinophils) resulting from impaired killing of bacteria and fungi. CGD is characterized by severe recurrent bacterial and fungal infections and dysregulated inflammatory responses resulting in granuloma formation and other inflammatory disorders such as colitis. Infections typically involve the lung (pneumonia), lymph nodes (lymphadenitis), liver (abscess), bone (osteomyelitis), and skin (abscesses or cellulitis). Granulomas typically involve the genitourinary system (bladder) and gastrointestinal tract (often the pylorus initially, and later the esophagus, jejunum, ileum, cecum, rectum, and perirectal area). Some males with X-linked CGD have McLeod neuroacanthocytosis syndrome as the result of a contiguous gene deletion. While CGD may present anytime from infancy to late adulthood, the vast majority of affected individuals are diagnosed before age five years. Use of antimicrobial prophylaxis and therapy has greatly improved overall survival. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of CGD is established in a proband with suggestive findings by identification of pathogenic variant(s) in one of six genes that encode or permit assembly of the subunits of phagocyte NADPH oxidase: biallelic pathogenic variants in CYBA, CYBC1, NCF1, NCF2, and NCF4 cause autosomal recessive CGD; pathogenic variants of CYBB cause X-linked CGD. Management Treatment of manifestations: A definitive microbiologic diagnosis is essential to proper treatment of infections. Newer azole drugs (voriconazole, posaconazole, isovuconazole) have expanded therapeutic options for fungal infections. Long courses of antimicrobials are often needed for adequate treatment.

GeneReviews percutaneous drainage or excisional surgery. Simultaneous administration of antimicrobials and corticosteroids can help resolve the associated heightened inflammatory response, including colitis. Prevention of primary manifestations: Lifelong daily antibacterial and antifungal prophylaxis is recommended; immunomodulatory therapy with interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) is part of the prophylactic regimen in many centers. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only known cure for CGD and is associated with excellent overall and event-free survival, especially when performed with matched donors at a younger age. Surveillance: Screening labs every 3-4 months in a healthy individual with CGD can aid in early detection and treatment of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic infections and noninfectious complications such as colitis, pulmonary granulomas, and pulmonary fibrosis. Agents/circumstances to avoid: (1) Decayed organic matter (e.g., mulching, gardening, leaf raking, house demolition) as inhalation of fungal spores can result in fulminant pneumonitis; (2) live bacterial vaccines including bacille Calmette-Gurin (BCG) vaccination and Salmonella typhi vaccination; (3) persons with CGD and McLeod neuroacanthocytosis syndrome: blood transfusions that are Kell antigen positive. Evaluation of relatives at risk: Early diagnosis of relatives at risk allows for prompt initiation of antimicrobial prophylaxis and other treatment. Pregnancy management: The major concern during the pregnancy of a woman known to have CGD is use of prophylactic antimicrobials: trimethoprim, a folic acid antagonist, is discontinued during pregnancy because of the high risk for birth defects. Although sulfamethoxazole is not known to increase the risk of birth defects in humans, it is typically administered in conjunction with trimethoprim. Data regarding teratogenicity of itraconazole are limited. Genetic counseling CGD associated with a pathogenic variant in CYBB is inherited in an X-linked manner. CGD associated with biallelic pathogenic variants in CYBA, CYBC1, NCF1, NCF2, or NCF4 is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. X-linked CGD. If the mother of an affected male is heterozygous for a CYBB pathogenic variant, the chance of transmitting it in each pregnancy is 50%. Males who inherit the pathogenic variant will be affected. Females who inherit the pathogenic variant will be heterozygous. Heterozygous females are typically not affected with CGD but are at substantial risk for inflammatory conditions. Once the CYBB pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, molecular genetic heterozygote detection for at-risk female relatives is possible. Autosomal recessive CGD. If both parents are known to be heterozygous for an autosomal recessive CGD-causing pathogenic variant, each sib of an affected individual has at conception a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being a carrier, and a 25% chance of inheriting neither of the familial pathogenic variants. Once the CGD-causing pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member, molecular genetic carrier testing for at-risk relatives is possible. Once the CGD-causing pathogenic variant(s) have been identified in an affected family member, prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.

Newly diagnosed individuals should be transferred as soon as possible to a pediatric center experienced in allogeneic stem cell transplantation in this disease. The collaboration of pediatricians, pediatric neurologists, ophthalmologists, and psychologists is required to determine best treatment of neurologic and ophthalmic issues, which may include surgical decompression of the optic nerve and hearing aids. Treatment of fractures by an experienced orthopedist and dental care with attention to tooth eruption, ankylosis, abscesses, cysts, and fistulas. ADOII. Orthopedic treatment for fractures and arthritis with attention to potential post-surgical complications (delayed union or non-union of fractures, infection); fractures near joints may require total joint arthroplasty. Medical treatment for arthritis with anti-inflammatory agents; transfusions for anemia and thrombocytopenia; surgical optic nerve decompression, hearing aids, and regular dental care and good oral hygiene. Prevention of primary manifestations: In ARO, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) can be curative; however, cranial nerve dysfunction is usually irreversible, and progressive neurologic sequelae occur in children with the neuronopathic form even after successful HSCT. Surveillance: Complete blood count, ophthalmologic examination, and audiologic evaluation at least once a year; dental evaluation every 6-12 months or as directed. For ARO, follow up as directed by the transplantation center following HSCT. Agents/circumstances to avoid: In ADOII, activities with high fracture risk. Orthopedic surgery should only be performed when absolutely necessary. Genetic counseling CLCN7-related osteopetrosis is inherited in an autosomal recessive or autosomal dominant manner: ARO is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner; about 40% of IAO is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner and about 60% in an autosomal dominant manner; and ADOII is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Autosomal recessive inheritance. If both parents are known to be heterozygous for a CLCN7 pathogenic variant associated with autosomal recessive osteopetrosis, each sib of an affected individual has at conception a 25% chance of inheriting biallelic pathogenic variants and being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of inheriting neither of the familial CLCN7 pathogenic variants. Carrier testing for at-risk relatives requires prior identification of the CLCN7 pathogenic variants in the family. Autosomal dominant inheritance. Most individuals diagnosed with autosomal dominant CLCN7-related osteopetrosis have an affected parent. Each child of an individual with autosomal dominant osteopetrosis has a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant. Once the CLCN7 pathogenic variant(s) have been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing and preimplantation genetic testing for CLCN7-related osteopetrosis are possible."

Physical abnormalities, present in approximately 75% of affected individuals, include one or more of the following: short stature, abnormal skin pigmentation, skeletal malformations of the upper and/or lower limbs, microcephaly, and ophthalmic and genitourinary tract anomalies. Progressive bone marrow failure with pancytopenia typically presents in the first decade, often initially with thrombocytopenia or leukopenia. The incidence of acute myeloid leukemia is 13% by age 50 years. Solid tumors particularly of the head and neck, skin, and genitourinary tract are more common in individuals with FA. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of FA is established in a proband with increased chromosome breakage and radial forms on cytogenetic testing of lymphocytes with diepoxybutane (DEB) and mitomycin C (MMC) and/or one of the following identified on molecular genetic testing: biallelic pathogenic variants in one of the 21 genes known to cause autosomal recessive FA; a heterozygous pathogenic variant in RAD51 known to cause autosomal dominant FA; or a hemizygous pathogenic variant in FANCB known to cause X-linked FA. Management Treatment of manifestations: Administration of oral androgens (e.g., oxymetholone) improves blood counts (red cell and platelets) in approximately 50% of individuals with FA; granulocyte colony-stimulating factor improves the neutrophil count in some individuals; hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only curative therapy for the hematologic manifestations of FA, but the high risk for solid tumors remains and may even be increased in those undergoing HSCT.

Prevention of primary manifestations: Human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccination to reduce the risk for gynecologic cancer in females, and possibly reduce the risk of oral cancer in all individuals. Prevention of secondary complications: T-cell depletion of the donor graft to minimize the risk of graft-vs-host disease; conditioning regimen without radiation prior to HSCT to reduce the subsequent risk of developing solid tumors.

Additional cancer surveillance for individuals with BRCA1-, BRCA2-, PALB2-, BRIP1-, and RAD51C-related FA. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Transfusions of red cells or platelets for persons who are candidates for HSCT; family members as blood donors if HSCT is being considered; blood products that are not filtered (leukodepleted) or irradiated; toxic agents that have been implicated in tumorigenesis; unsafe sex practices, which increase the risk of HPV-associated malignancy; excessive sun exposure. Radiographic studies solely for the purpose of surveillance (i.e., in the absence of clinical indications) should be minimized. Evaluation of relatives at risk: DEB/MMC testing or molecular genetic testing (if the family-specific pathogenic variants are known) of all sibs of a proband for early diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring for physical abnormalities, bone marrow failure, and related cancers. Genetic counseling Fanconi anemia (FA) can be inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, an autosomal dominant manner (RAD51-related FA), or an X-linked manner (FANCB-related FA). Autosomal recessive FA: Each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of inheriting both pathogenic variants and being affected, a 50% chance of inheriting one pathogenic variant and being a heterozygote, and a 25% chance of inheriting neither of the familial FA-related pathogenic variants. Heterozygotes are not at risk for autosomal recessive FA. However, heterozygous mutation of a subset of FA-related genes (e.g., BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2, BRIP1, and RAD51C) is associated with an increased risk for breast and other cancers. Autosomal dominant FA: Given that all affected individuals with RAD51-related FA reported to date have the disorder as a result of a de novo RAD51 pathogenic variant, the risk to other family members is presumed to be low. Anemia 3 X-linked FA: For carrier females the chance of transmitting the pathogenic variant in each pregnancy is 50%; males who inherit the pathogenic variant will be affected; females who inherit the pathogenic variant will be carriers and will usually not be affected. Carrier testing for at-risk relatives (for autosomal recessive and X-linked FA) and prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing are possible if the pathogenic variant(s) in the family are known."

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics GATA1-related cytopenia is characterized by thrombocytopenia and/or anemia ranging from mild to severe. Thrombocytopenia typically presents in infancy as a bleeding disorder with easy bruising and mucosal bleeding (e.g., epistaxis). Anemia ranges from minimal (mild dyserythropoiesis) to severe (hydrops fetalis requiring in utero transfusion). At the extreme end of the clinical spectrum, severe hemorrhage and/or erythrocyte transfusion dependence are lifelong; at the milder end, anemia and the risk for bleeding may decrease spontaneously with age. One or more of the following may also be present: neutropenia, splenomegaly, cryptorchidism, hypospadias, and rarely additional clinical features of Diamond-Blackfan anemia. Heterozygous females may have mild-to-moderate symptoms such as menorrhagia. Rarely, GATA1-related cytopenia can progress to myelodysplastic syndrome or aplastic anemia. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of GATA1-related cytopenia is established in a male proband with cytopenia resulting from ineffective hematopoiesis by identification of a hemizygous pathogenic variant in GATA1 by molecular genetic testing.

GeneReviews Supportive care: Platelet transfusions for moderate-to-severe epistaxis, severe gingival bleeding, or other clinically significant bleeding; DDAVP may be helpful for short-term management of mild-to-moderate bleeding; platelet transfusion prior to surgical or invasive dental procedures for individuals with a history of pathologic bleeding, thrombocytopenia, and/or platelet dysfunction; red blood cell transfusions for clinical manifestations of anemia (fatigue, tachycardia); iron chelation therapy as needed for chronic red blood cell transfusions; extended pre-transfusion red blood cell phenotyping and consideration of Rh and K antigen matching for those receiving frequent transfusions. Treatment for neutropenia includes counseling regarding infection risk; prophylactic antibiotics when indicated; prompt evaluation when febrile; empiric parenteral antibiotics for febrile individuals with severe neutropenia. HSCT can be curative for those with severe disease. Surveillance: Complete blood count (CBC) with frequency based on disease severity; annual CBC in those with mild cytopenia(s) and monthly CBC in those with severe cytopenia(s) that require intervention such as red blood cell transfusion. Monitor for iron overload in those with frequent erythrocyte transfusions. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Those with thrombocytopenia and/or platelet aggregation defects should avoid antiplatelet agents including aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g., ibuprofen) and avoid contact sports or activities with a high risk of trauma. Individuals with severe neutropenia should avoid close contact with persons who have a communicable disease to minimize risk of infection. Individuals with significant splenomegaly should avoid contact sports, which increase the risk of traumatic splenic rupture. Evaluation of relatives at risk: If a GATA1 pathogenic variant has been identified in the family, molecular genetic testing of at-risk relatives can be offered. At-risk relatives who choose not to have molecular genetic testing should have a CBC to evaluate for thrombocytopenia, anemia, and/or neutropenia. Genetic counseling GATA1-related cytopenia is inherited in an X-linked manner. If the mother of the proband has a GATA1 pathogenic variant, the chance of the mother transmitting it in each pregnancy is 50%.

Childhood-onset chorea, the hallmark feature of NKX2-1-related disorders, may or may not be associated with pulmonary disease or congenital hypothyroidism. Age of onset of chorea varies from early infancy (most commonly) to late childhood or adolescence and may progress into the second decade, after which it remains static or (rarely) remits. Pulmonary disease, the second most common manifestation, can include respiratory distress syndrome in neonates, interstitial lung disease in young children, and pulmonary fibrosis in older individuals. The risk for pulmonary carcinoma is increased in young adults with NKX2-1-related disorders. Thyroid dysfunction, occurring as a result of thyroid dysgenesis, can present as congenital or compensated hypothyroidism. In one review, 50% of affected individuals had the full brain-lung-thyroid syndrome, 30% had brain and thyroid involvement only, and 13% had chorea only.

In OPD2, females are less severely affected than related affected males. Most males with OPD2 die during the first year of life, usually from thoracic hypoplasia resulting in pulmonary insufficiency. Males who live beyond the first year of life are usually developmentally delayed and require respiratory support and assistance with feeding. In FMD1, females are less severely affected than related affected males. Males do not experience a progressive skeletal dysplasia but may have joint contractures and hand and foot malformations. Progressive scoliosis is observed in both affected males and females. In MNS, wide phenotypic variability is observed; some individuals are diagnosed in adulthood, while others require respiratory support and have reduced longevity. MNS in males results in perinatal lethality in all recorded cases. TODPD, seen only in females, is characterized by a skeletal dysplasia that is most prominent in the digits, pigmentary defects of the skin, and recurrent digital fibromata. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of an X-OPD spectrum disorder is established in a male proband with characteristic clinical and radiographic features and a family history consistent with X-linked inheritance.

Identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in FLNA by molecular genetic testing can confirm the diagnosis if clinical features, radiographic features, and/or family history are inconclusive. Management Treatment of manifestations: Surgical treatment may be required for hand and foot malformations. Monitoring and surgical intervention as needed for scoliosis; physiotherapy for contractures; cosmetic surgery may correct the fronto-orbital deformity; continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and mandibular distraction can improve airway complications related to micrognathia; hearing aids for deafness; evaluation with anesthesiology if intubation and ventilation are required due to laryngeal stenosis. Surveillance: Annual clinical evaluation for orthopedic complications including contractures and scoliosis; monitor head size and shape with each clinical evaluation in infancy for craniosynostosis; annual clinical evaluation for apnea with somnography studies as indicated; annual audiology evaluation. Evaluation of relatives at risk: Consider molecular genetic testing for the family-specific pathogenic variant in at- risk relatives. Genetic counseling The X-OPD spectrum disorders are by definition inherited in an X-linked manner. If a parent of a proband with OPD1, OPD2, or FMD1 has the FLNA pathogenic variant, the chance of transmitting the variant in each pregnancy is 50%. When the mother has an FLNA pathogenic variant, males who inherit the variant will be affected; females who inherit the variant have a range of phenotypic expression. If the mother of a proband with TODPD or MNS has the FLNA pathogenic variant, the chance of transmitting the variant in each pregnancy is 50%. Males who inherit the variant will be affected and usually exhibit embryonic lethality or die perinatally (MNS); females who inherit the variant have a range of phenotypic expression. Males with OPD2 do not reproduce; males with OPD1 or FMD1 transmit the pathogenic variant to all of their daughters and none of their sons. Prenatal testing and preimplantation genetic testing are possible if the pathogenic variant in the family is known."

The three PCH phenotypes (which differ mainly in life expectancy) were considered to be distinct entities before their molecular basis was known. PCH2. Children usually succumb before age ten years (those with PCH4 and 5 usually succumb as neonates). Children with PCH2 have generalized clonus, uncoordinated sucking and swallowing, impaired cognitive development, lack of voluntary motor development, cortical blindness, and an increased risk for rhabdomyolysis during severe infections. Epilepsy is present in approximately 50%. PCH4. Neonates often have seizures, multiple joint contractures (\\\"arthrogryposis\\\"), generalized clonus, and central respiratory impairment. PCH5 resembles PCH4 and has been described in one family. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of TSEN54-PCH is suspected in children with characteristic neuroradiologic and neurologic findings, and is confirmed by the presence of biallelic TSEN54 pathogenic variants. Management Treatment of manifestations: PCH2: Treatment of irritability, swallowing incoordination, epilepsy, and central visual impairment is symptomatic. Physiotherapy can be helpful.

Untreated children may have repeated, often unrecognized, neurologic crises lasting one to seven days that can include change in mental status, abdominal pain, peripheral neuropathy, and/or respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. Death in the untreated child usually occurs before age ten years, typically from liver failure, neurologic crisis, or hepatocellular carcinoma. Combined treatment with nitisinone and a low-tyrosine diet has resulted in a greater than 90% survival rate, normal growth, improved liver function, prevention of cirrhosis, correction of renal tubular acidosis, and improvement in secondary rickets. Diagnosis/testing Tyrosinemia type I results from deficiency of the enzyme fumarylacetoacetase (FAH). The diagnosis is established in a proband with typical biochemical findings (increased succinylacetone concentration in the blood and urine; elevated plasma concentrations of tyrosine, methionine, and phenylalanine; and elevated urinary concentration of tyrosine metabolites and the compound -ALA) and/or by the identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in FAH on molecular genetic testing.

If the blood concentration of phenylalanine becomes too low (<20 mol/L), additional natural protein should be added to the diet. Prior to the availability of nitisinone, the only definitive therapy for tyrosinemia type I was liver transplantation, which now should be reserved for those children who have severe liver failure at presentation and fail to respond to nitisinone therapy or have documented evidence of malignant changes in hepatic tissue. Prevention of primary manifestations: Initiation of treatment with nitisinone as soon as the diagnosis is confirmed. Prevention of secondary complications: Treatment of early signs of carnitine deficiency, osteoporosis, and rickets that are secondary to renal tubular Fanconi syndrome. Surveillance: Guidelines for routine surveillance of individuals with tyrosinemia type I have been established. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Inappropriate protein intake. Evaluation of relatives at risk: All subsequent children of the parents of a child with tyrosinemia type I should have urine and blood succinylacetone analyzed as soon as possible after birth to enable the earliest possible diagnosis and initiation of therapy. If the pathogenic variants in the family are known, prenatal molecular genetic testing of an at-risk pregnancy may be considered. Pregnancy management: Little data exist on the use of nitisinone during human pregnancy; however, at least two women have given birth to healthy infants while receiving therapeutic doses of nitisinone.

Retinal hemangioblastomas may be the initial manifestation of VHL and can cause vision loss. Cerebellar hemangioblastomas may be associated with headache, vomiting, gait disturbances, or ataxia. Spinal hemangioblastomas and related syrinx usually present with pain. Sensory and motor loss may develop with cord compression. Renal cell carcinoma occurs in about 70% of individuals with VHL and is the leading cause of mortality. Pheochromocytomas can be asymptomatic but may cause sustained or episodic hypertension. Pancreatic lesions often remain asymptomatic and rarely cause endocrine or exocrine insufficiency. Endolymphatic sac tumors can cause hearing loss of varying severity, which can be a presenting symptom. Cystadenomas of the epididymis are relatively common. They rarely cause problems, unless bilateral, in which case they may result in infertility.

Hypotonia and hyperextensible joints can result in delayed attainment of motor milestones. Feeding difficulties often lead to poor weight gain in infancy. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of WS is established by identification of a heterozygous 1.5- to 1.8-Mb deletion of the Williams- Beuren syndrome critical region (WBSCR) on chromosome 7q11.23.

The cardinal features of classic HED become obvious during childhood. The scalp hair is thin, lightly pigmented, and slow growing. Sweating, although present, is greatly deficient, leading to episodes of hyperthermia until the affected individual or family acquires experience with environmental modifications to control temperature. Only a few abnormally formed teeth erupt, at a later-than-average age. Physical growth and psychomotor development are otherwise within normal limits. Mild HED is characterized by mild manifestations of any or all the characteristic features. Diagnosis/testing Classic HED can be diagnosed after infancy based on physical features in most affected individuals. Identification of a hemizygous EDA pathogenic variant in an affected male or biallelic EDAR, EDARADD, or WNT10A pathogenic variants in an affected male or female confirms the diagnosis. The diagnosis of mild HED is established in a female by identification of a heterozygous EDA, EDAR, EDARADD, or WNT10A pathogenic variant. The diagnosis of mild HED is established in a male by identification of a heterozygous EDAR, EDARADD, or WNT10A pathogenic variant. Management Treatment of manifestations: Wigs or special hair care formulas for sparse, dry hair may be useful. Access to an adequate water supply and a cool environment during hot weather. Skin care products for eczema and exposures that exacerbate dry skin.

Nasal and aural concretions may be removed with suction devices or forceps as needed by an otolaryngologist. Prevention of nasal concretions through humidification of ambient air is helpful. Lubrication eye drops. Management of recurrent respiratory infections and asthma per primary care provider with referral to allergist and/or pulmonologist as needed. Surveillance: Dental evaluation by age one year with follow-up dental evaluations every six to 12 months. Assess for skin, hair, ophthalmologic, and respiratory manifestations annually and/or as needed. Assess for abnormal nasal and aural secretions annually and/or as needed. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Exposure to extreme heat. Evaluation of relatives at risk: If the family-specific pathogenic variant(s) are known, molecular genetic testing of at-risk relatives should be offered to permit early diagnosis and treatment, especially to avoid hyperthermia. Pregnancy management: Optimal prenatal nutrition for mothers who are unaffected heterozygotes or those who are affected with HED. Affected women at risk for hyperthermia should not become overheated during pregnancy. Genetic counseling EDA-related HED is inherited in an X-linked manner. EDAR-, EDARADD-, and WNT10A-related HED are inherited in an autosomal recessive or an autosomal dominant manner. X-linked HED. If the mother of a proband is heterozygous for an EDA pathogenic variant, the chance of the mother transmitting it in each pregnancy is 50%. If the father of the proband has an EDA pathogenic variant, he will transmit it to all his daughters and none of his sons. Males who inherit the pathogenic variant will be affected; females who inherit the pathogenic variant will be heterozygous and may show manifestations of ectodermal dysplasia. Molecular genetic identification of female heterozygotes requires prior identification of the EDA pathogenic variant in the family. Autosomal recessive HED. The parents of a child with autosomal recessive HED are presumed to be heterozygous for a pathogenic variant in EDAR, EDARADD, or WNT10A. If both parents are known to be heterozygous for a pathogenic variant, each sib of an affected individual has at conception a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being heterozygous, and a 25% chance of inheriting neither of the familial pathogenic variants. Heterozygote detection for at-risk relatives requires prior identification of the EDAR, EDARADD, or WNT10A pathogenic variants in the family. Autosomal dominant HED. Some individuals diagnosed with autosomal dominant HED have an affected parent. Each child of an individual with autosomal dominant HED has a 50% chance of inheriting the EDAR, EDARADD, or WNT10A pathogenic variant. Once the EDA, EDAR, EDARADD, or WNT10A pathogenic variant(s) have been identified in an affected family member, prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing for HED are possible."

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Most children with carbonic anhydrase VA (CA-VA) deficiency reported to date have presented between day 2 of life and early childhood (up to age 20 months) with hyperammonemic encephalopathy (i.e., lethargy, feeding intolerance, weight loss, tachypnea, seizures, and coma). Given that fewer than 20 affected individuals have been reported to date, the ranges of initial presentations and long-term prognoses are not completely understood. As of 2021 the oldest known affected individual is an adolescent. Almost all affected individuals reported to date have shown normal psychomotor development and no further episodes of metabolic crisis; however, a few have shown mild learning difficulties or delayed motor skills. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of CA-VA deficiency is established in children with suggestive clinical findings (metabolic hyperammonemic encephalopathy), laboratory findings (complex acid-base status including respiratory alkalosis and metabolic acidosis; elevated plasma glutamine and alanine and low-to-normal citrulline; and urine organic acid analysis showing elevations of carboxylase substrates and related metabolites suggestive of multiple carboxylase deficiency), and biallelic pathogenic variants in CA5A identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Acute care: Hospital admission for children with insufficient oral intake and/or signs of metabolic decompensation such as encephalopathy in order to provide IV fluids (maintenance glucose plus extra calories via IV lipids) and to monitor plasma ammonia, serum lactate, serum glucose, blood gases, electrolytes, and liver parameters. If ammonia-lowering medication is needed, consider use of carglumic acid, which (while not yet approved for this indication) has anecdotally shortened the period of hyperammonemia. Although other ammonia-lowering medications such as sodium benzoate could also be reasonable, no conclusive information has been published to date.

GeneReviews To prevent metabolic decompensation during any catabolic state (viral illness or fasting conditions): Use a sick day formula (i.e., with extra calories and lipids, with but limited proteins) and monitor parameters per acute care protocols. Surveillance: Follow up during infancy and early childhood with a metabolic disease specialist every three to six months for physical and neurologic examinations. If asymptomatic and no further episodes, monitoring can be relaxed during childhood but a sick day regime/emergency plan should be provided and followed. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Acetazolamide as it inhibits carbonic anhydrase activity. If anti-seizure medications are necessary, avoid topiramate based on its action as carbonic anhydrase inhibitor. Evaluation of relatives at risk: Neonatal care for: An affected infant diagnosed prenatally: Delivery in hospital with monitoring for ~3 days (including physical examination and monitoring especially of plasma ammonia, serum lactate, serum glucose, and blood gases) An infant at risk because of a previous affected sib: Close clinical monitoring for the first week of life by a healthcare professional and immediate action if symptoms (of hyperammonemia or hypoglycemia) occur Genetic counseling CA-VA deficiency is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. If both parents are known to be heterozygous for a CA5A pathogenic variant, each sib of an affected individual has at conception a 25% chance of inheriting two CA5A pathogenic variants and usually being affected, a 50% chance of inheriting one pathogenic variant and being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of inheriting neither pathogenic variant being unaffected and not a carrier. Once the CA5A pathogenic variants in a family are known, carrier testing for at-risk relatives, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk, and preimplantation genetic testing are possible. Note: The results of prenatal testing cannot be used to predict with certainty whether or not an individual will be affected, as asymptomatic individuals with biallelic CA5A pathogenic variants have been identified."

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Congenital contractural arachnodactyly (CCA) appears to comprise a broad phenotypic spectrum. Classic CCA is characterized by arachnodactyly; flexion contractures of multiple joints including elbows, knees, hips, ankles, and/or fingers; kyphoscoliosis (usually progressive); a marfanoid habitus (a long and slender build, dolichostenomelia, pectus deformity, muscular hypoplasia, highly arched palate); and abnormal \\\"crumpled\\\" ears. At the mildest end, parents who are diagnosed retrospectively upon evaluation of their more severely affected child may show a lean body build, mild arachnodactyly, mild contractures without impairment, and minor ear abnormalities. At the most severe end is \\\"severe CCA with cardiovascular and/or gastrointestinal anomalies,\\\" a rare phenotype in infants with pronounced features of CCA (severe crumpling of the ears, arachnodactyly, contractures, congenital scoliosis, and/or hypotonia) and severe cardiovascular and/or gastrointestinal anomalies. Phenotypic expression can vary within and between families. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of CCA can be established in a proband with suggestive findings and a heterozygous FBN2 pathogenic variant identified by molecular genetic testing; however, locus heterogeneity is likely given that only 25%-75% of individuals with clinically diagnosed CCA have an identifiable FBN2 pathogenic variant. Because CCA can be difficult to diagnose clinically, a clinical scoring system based on presence or absence of crumpled ears, musculoskeletal findings, highly arched palate, and micrognathia can be used. Management Treatment of manifestations of classic CCA: Standard management of contractures, clubfeet, kyphoscoliosis including surgical intervention as needed; early physical therapy to improve mobility and occupational therapy to improve camptodactyly. Aortic root dilatation, correction of refractive errors, and palatal abnormalities are managed in a standard manner.

GeneReviews Surveillance for classic CCA: Annual evaluation for kyphosis/scoliosis if not present at initial evaluation; routine measurement of aortic root diameter for evidence of aortic dilatation; routine assessment of visual acuity and refractive error; annual assessment of orthodontic needs after age eight years. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Contact sports and activities that stress joints; LASIK eye surgery, which may increase the risk for keratoconus in those with predisposing ocular conditions. Evaluation of relatives at risk: Clarification of the genetic status of apparently asymptomatic or self-reportedly asymptomatic at-risk relatives by molecular genetic testing if the familial FBN2 variant is known, otherwise by clinical examination to identify those with a low but potential risk for aortic and/or ocular complications. Pregnancy management: Although no complications related to pregnancy or delivery have been reported in women with CCA, it is advisable to perform an echocardiography preconceptually and to increase cardiac surveillance during pregnancy in women with dilatation of the aortic root. Genetic counseling CCA is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. While many individuals with CCA have an affected parent, as many as 50% may have a de novo FBN2 pathogenic variant. If a parent of a proband has clinical features of CCA and/or is known to have the FBN2 pathogenic variant identified in the proband, the risk to sibs of the proband is 50%. Because intrafamilial clinical variability is observed in CCA, a heterozygous sib may have a more or less severe phenotypic presentation than the proband. Once the FBN2 pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing and preimplantation genetic testing are possible."

The clinical phenotype in females with SBH varies widely with cognitive abilities that range from average or mild cognitive impairment to severe intellectual disability and language impairment. Seizures, which frequently are refractory to anti-seizure medication, may be either focal or generalized and behavioral problems may also be observed.

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics The clinical manifestations of glycogen storage disease type IV (GSD IV) discussed in this entry span a continuum of different subtypes with variable ages of onset, severity, and clinical features. Clinical findings vary extensively both within and between families. The fatal perinatal neuromuscular subtype presents in utero with fetal akinesia deformation sequence, including decreased fetal movements, polyhydramnios, and fetal hydrops. Death usually occurs in the neonatal period. The congenital neuromuscular subtype presents in the newborn period with profound hypotonia, respiratory distress, and dilated cardiomyopathy. Death usually occurs in early infancy. Infants with the classic (progressive) hepatic subtype may appear normal at birth, but rapidly develop failure to thrive; hepatomegaly, liver dysfunction, and progressive liver cirrhosis; hypotonia; and cardiomyopathy. Without liver transplantation, death from liver failure usually occurs by age five years. Children with the non-progressive hepatic subtype tend to present with hepatomegaly, liver dysfunction, myopathy, and hypotonia; however, they are likely to survive without progression of the liver disease and may not show cardiac, skeletal muscle, or neurologic involvement. The childhood neuromuscular subtype is rare and the course is variable, ranging from onset in the second decade with a mild disease course to a more severe, progressive course resulting in death in the third decade. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis is established in a proband by the demonstration of glycogen branching enzyme (GBE) deficiency in liver, muscle, or skin fibroblasts or the identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in GBE1 on molecular genetic testing.

Management GeneReviews Treatment of manifestations: Management should involve a multidisciplinary team including specialists in hepatology, neurology, nutrition, medical or biochemical genetics, and child development. Liver transplantation is the only treatment option for individuals with the progressive hepatic subtype of GSD IV who develop liver failure; however, the risk for morbidity and mortality is high, in part because of the extrahepatic manifestations of GSD type IV, especially cardiomyopathy. Children with skeletal myopathy and/or hypotonia warrant developmental evaluation and physical therapy as needed. Those with cardiomyopathy warrant care by a cardiologist. Heart transplant may be an option in individuals with severe cardiac involvement. Prevention of secondary complications: Prevent nutritional deficiencies (e.g., of fat-soluble vitamins) by ensuring adequate dietary intake; prevent perioperative bleeding by assessment of a coagulation profile and use of fresh frozen plasma as needed. Surveillance: No clinical guidelines for surveillance are available. The following evaluations are suggested (with frequency varying according to disease severity): liver function tests including liver transaminases, albumin, and coagulation profile (PT and PTT); abdominal ultrasound examination; echocardiogram; neurologic assessment; nutritional assessment. If cardiomyopathy was not observed on baseline screening echocardiogram at the time of initial diagnosis, repeat echocardiograms every three months during infancy, every six months during early childhood, and annually thereafter. Evaluation of relatives at risk: If the GBE1 pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member, test at-risk relatives to allow for early diagnosis and management of disease manifestations. Genetic counseling GSD IV is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Although affected sibs are expected to manifest the same subtype of GSD IV, the age of onset and presentation may differ. Carrier testing for at-risk family members and prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk are possible based on molecular testing if the pathogenic variants in the family have been identified. If the pathogenic variants have not been identified, GBE testing on cultured amniocytes can be performed for prenatal diagnosis."

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Huntington disease-like 2 (HDL2) typically presents in midlife with a relentless progressive triad of movement, emotional, and cognitive abnormalities which lead to death within ten to 20 years. HDL2 cannot be differentiated from Huntington disease clinically. Neurologic abnormalities include chorea, hypokinesia (rigidity, bradykinesia), dysarthria, and hyperreflexia in the later stages of the disease. There is a strong correlation between the duration of the disease and the progression of the motor and cognitive disorder. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of HDL2 rests on positive family history, characteristic clinical findings, and the detection of an expansion of 40 or more CTG trinucleotide repeats in JPH3. Management Treatment of manifestations: Treatment is symptomatic and is presumably similar to that for HD and other neurodegenerative disorders although this must be considered speculative pending objective data. Pharmacologic agents that may suppress abnormal movements include tetrabenazine and its derivatives, low- dose neuroleptic agents such as fluphenazine and haloperidol. Antidepressants, antipsychotics, mood stabilizers (lithium, valproic acid, carbamazepine, and lamotrigine), and occasionally stimulants may improve psychiatric manifestations. Education about the course of disease and environmental interventions (regular schedules, use of lists to assist memory). Remove loose rugs and clutter from the individual's home and minimize or eliminate the need for stairs to help prevent falls and other injuries; driving may need to be curtailed or limited to prevent risk of accidents; food should be prepared in such a manner as to prevent choking.

GeneReviews Surveillance: Monitor: nutrition and swallowing in order to implement feeding changes when necessary to minimize risk of aspiration; gait and use appropriate strategies or devices to minimize falls; driving to assure that affected individuals do not present a danger to themselves or others; mood and irritability, such that measures to decrease the risk of suicide, other behavioral abnormalities, and distress may be implemented. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Any agents that increase ataxia should be used with caution; avoid polypharmacy, which may exacerbate delirium. Genetic counseling HDL2 is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. HDL2 resulting from a de novo pathogenic variant has not been reported but is theoretically possible. Offspring of an individual with HDL2 have a 50% chance of inheriting the HDL2-causing allele. Predictive testing in asymptomatic adults at risk is available but requires careful thought (including pre- and post-test genetic counseling) as there is currently no cure for the disorder. Predictive testing is not considered appropriate for asymptomatic at-risk individuals younger than age 18 years. Prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible once an HDL2-causing expansion has been identified in an affected family member."

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Familial lipoprotein lipase (LPL) deficiency usually presents in childhood and is characterized by very severe hypertriglyceridemia with episodes of abdominal pain, recurrent acute pancreatitis, eruptive cutaneous xanthomata, and hepatosplenomegaly. Clearance of chylomicrons from the plasma is impaired, causing triglycerides to accumulate in plasma and the plasma to have a milky (lactescent or lipemic) appearance. Symptoms usually resolve with restriction of total dietary fat to 20 g/day. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of LPL deficiency is established in a proband by the identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in LPL on molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Treatment is based on medical nutrition therapy to maintain plasma triglyceride concentration below 1000 mg/dL. Maintenance of triglyceride levels below 2000 mg/dL prevents recurrent abdominal pain. Restriction of dietary fat to 20 g/day or 15% of a total energy intake is usually sufficient to reduce plasma triglyceride concentration and to keep the individual with familial LPL deficiency free of symptoms. An acute pancreatitis episode is treated with standard care. Prevention of secondary complications: Prevention of recurrent acute pancreatitis decreases the risk of developing diabetes mellitus.

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics COL1A1/2 osteogenesis imperfecta (COL1A1/2-OI) is characterized by fractures with minimal or absent trauma, variable dentinogenesis imperfecta (DI), and, in adult years, hearing loss. The clinical features of COL1A1/2-OI represent a continuum ranging from perinatal lethality to individuals with severe skeletal deformities, mobility impairments, and very short stature to nearly asymptomatic individuals with a mild predisposition to fractures, normal dentition, normal stature, and normal life span. Fractures can occur in any bone but are most common in the extremities. DI is characterized by gray or brown teeth that may appear translucent, wear down, and break easily. COL1A1/2-OI has been classified into four types based on clinical presentation and radiographic findings. This classification system can be helpful in providing information about prognosis and management for a given individual. The four more common OI types are now referred to as follows: Classic non-deforming OI with blue sclerae (previously OI type I) Perinatally lethal OI (previously OI type II) Progressively deforming OI (previously OI type III) Common variable OI with normal sclerae (previously OI type IV) Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of COL1A1/2-OI is established in a proband by identification of a heterozygous pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant in COL1A1 or COL1A2 by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Ideally, management is by a multidisciplinary team including specialists in medical management of OI, clinical genetics, orthopedics, rehabilitation medicine, pediatric dentistry, otology/ otolaryngology, and mental health.

GeneReviews of treatment include: bracing of limbs depending on OI severity; orthotics to stabilize lax joints; physical activity; physical and occupational therapy to maximize bone stability, improve mobility, prevent contractures, prevent head and spine deformity, and improve muscle strengthening; mobility devices as needed; and pain management. Fractures are treated with: as short a period of immobility as is practical; small and lightweight casts; physical therapy as soon as casts are removed; and intramedullary rodding when indicated to provide anatomic positioning of limbs. Progressive scoliosis in severe OI may not respond well to conservative or surgical management. Bisphosphonates continue to be used most extensively in severely affected children with OI. Surgical treatment for basilar impression should be done in a center experienced in the necessary procedures. Dental care strives to maintain both primary and permanent dentition, a functional bite or occlusion, optimal gingival health, and overall appearance. Conductive hearing loss may be improved with middle ear surgery; later-onset sensorineural hearing loss is treated in the same manner as when caused by other conditions. Mental health support through psychiatry/psychology and appropriate social worker intervention can improve quality of life. Prevention of secondary complications: During general anesthesia, proper positioning on the operating room table and use of cushioning such as egg crate foam can help avoid fractures. Surveillance: Orthopedic evaluation with ancillary therapy services (physical and rehabilitation medicine) as indicated every three months until age one year, every six months from ages one to three years, and then annually or with any new fractures. Physical therapy evaluation in infancy for those with motor delays and as needed to improve mobility and function. CT and/or MRI examination with views across the base of the skull to evaluate for basilar impression if concerning signs or symptoms are present. Cervical spine flexion and extension radiographs in children able to cooperate with the examination or before participating in sporting activities in more mildly affected individuals. Twice-yearly dental visits beginning in early childhood or even infancy for those with (or at risk for) DI. Hearing evaluation at three- to five-year intervals from age five years until hearing loss is identified, then as indicated based on the nature and degree of hearing loss and associated interventions. Agents/circumstances to be avoided: Contact sports should be avoided. Genetic counseling COL1A1/2-OI is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. The proportion of affected individuals who represent simplex cases (i.e., a single occurrence of the disorder in a family) varies by the severity of disease. Approximately 60% of probands with mild OI represent simplex cases. Virtually 100% of probands with progressively deforming or perinatally lethal OI represent simplex cases and have a de novo pathogenic variant or a pathogenic variant inherited from a parent with somatic and/or germline mosaicism. Parental somatic and/or germline mosaicism is present in up to 16% of families. Each child of an individual with a dominantly inherited form of COL1A1/2-OI has a 50% chance of inheriting the causative variant and of developing some manifestations of OI. Prenatal testing in at-risk pregnancies can be performed by molecular genetic testing if the COL1A1 or COL1A2 causative variant has been identified in an affected relative. Ultrasound examination performed in a center with experience in diagnosing OI can be valuable in the prenatal diagnosis of the lethal form and most severe forms prior to 20 weeks' gestation; milder forms may be detected later in pregnancy if fractures or deformities occur."

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics The phenotypic spectrum of ATP8B1 deficiency ranges from severe through moderate to mild. Severe ATP8B1 deficiency is characterized by infantile-onset cholestasis that progresses to cirrhosis, hepatic failure, and early death. Although mild-to-moderate ATP8B1 deficiency initially was thought to involve intermittent symptomatic cholestasis with a lack of hepatic fibrosis, it is now known that hepatic fibrosis may be present early in the disease course. Furthermore, in some persons with ATP8B1 deficiency the clinical findings can span the phenotypic spectrum, shifting over time from the mild end of the spectrum (episodic cholestasis) to the severe end of the spectrum (persistent cholestasis). Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) is common across the phenotypic spectrum. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of ATP8B1 deficiency is established in a proband with suggestive clinical and laboratory findings and biallelic pathogenic variants in ATP8B1 identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Cholestasis: pharmacotherapy is ineffective regardless of disease severity. In severe disease: the primary surgical therapy is interruption of the enterohepatic circulation which can reduce pruritus and slow or reverse the progression to hepatic fibrosis; when cirrhosis is present, liver transplantation may be the definitive therapy. Notably for some, secretory diarrhea can continue or worsen following liver transplantation. In mild-to-moderate disease, nasobiliary drainage and extracorporeal liver support may hasten the end of an episode of cholestasis. Pruritus: in severe disease pharmacotherapy has historically been ineffective; however, recent US Food and Drug Administration approval of ileal bile acid transporter inhibitors to treat pruritus introduces a novel therapeutic approach that holds great promise. Other options include UVB light therapy and plasmapheresis. In mild-to-moderate disease, pharmacotherapy may be efficacious.

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Primary hyperoxaluria type 1 (PH1) is caused by deficiency of the liver peroxisomal enzyme alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase (AGT), which catalyzes the conversion of glyoxylate to glycine. When AGT activity is reduced or absent, glyoxylate is converted to oxalate, which cannot be metabolized and must be excreted by the kidneys. Insoluble calcium oxalate crystals form due to high urinary oxalate concentration. Urinary crystals aggregate, leading to nephrolithiasis (i.e., calcium oxalate kidney stones) in the renal pelvis / urinary tract; often the crystals deposit in kidney parenchyma (nephrocalcinosis). The age at presentation of PH1 ranges from infancy (age <12 months) in 10% of individuals, childhood/adolescence (age 1-17 years) in 70%, and adulthood (age 18 years) in 20%. The natural history of untreated PH1 is (1) progressive decline in kidney function due to complications of nephrolithiasis (e.g., urinary obstruction, infection) and nephrocalcinosis, and (2) in persons with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD), high plasma oxalate concentrations result in other organ and tissue damage from calcium oxalate deposition (i.e., \\\"oxalosis\\\"), most commonly in the bones, heart, and retina. In the absence of treatment, progression of oxalosis results in death from kidney failure and/or other organ involvement. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of PH1 is established in a proband with supportive laboratory findings (excess excretion of oxalate in the urine and/or markedly increased plasma oxalate concentration) and biallelic pathogenic variants in AGXT identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Targeted therapies: (1) Pyridoxine (vitamin B6) to reduce liver oxalate production in individuals with missense AGXT variants known to be pyridoxine responsive; (2) RNA interference (RNAi) therapeutics (lumasiran and nedosiran) that target specific hepatic enzymes to reduce liver overproduction of oxalate; and (3) liver transplantation to restore normal hepatic AGT enzyme activity.

Copyright 1993-2024, University of Washington, Seattle. GeneReviews is a registered trademark of the University of Washington, Seattle. All rights reserved. GeneReviews Supportive care: Goal is to reduce stone formation, reduce frequency of symptomatic stone events, and preserve kidney function. Advanced loss of kidney function may require dialysis and kidney transplantation. Kidney and liver transplantation can be performed simultaneously or sequentially. Surveillance: Individuals with PH1 require lifelong care including regularly scheduled assessments of (1) kidney function and urinalysis; (2) urine volume and urine oxalate excretion; (3) kidney ultrasound examination; and (4) signs and symptoms of systemic oxalosis (most commonly involving bones, heart, and retina). The frequency of these assessments is based on the individual's kidney function. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Intravascular volume depletion; high doses of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or any pharmacologic agent that can compromise kidney function; intake of vitamin C exceeding the recommended daily allowance; loop diuretics; large intake of foods high in oxalate (e.g., chocolate, rhubarb, starfruit). Evaluation of relatives at risk: Family screening for PH1, particularly sibs of the proband, is warranted given intrafamilial variability, significant disease risks even in asymptomatic family members, and availability of therapeutic agents highly effective in reducing urine oxalate. Pregnancy management: Although pregnancy does not appear to be an important risk factor for developing end- stage kidney disease (ESKD) in most women with PH1, close monitoring is warranted by both an obstetrician and nephrologist during pregnancy and the postpartum period. Of note, the recently approved targeted therapies, lumasiran and nedosiran, have not been studied during human pregnancy. While preclinical animal studies have been reassuring, pending more clinical data the authors would advise women to discontinue use of either therapy prior to becoming pregnant and during pregnancy. Genetic counseling PH1 is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. If both parents are known to be heterozygous for an AGXT pathogenic variant, each sib of an affected individual has at conception a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Once the AGXT pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member, carrier testing for at-risk relatives and prenatal/preimplantation genetic testing are possible."

    "chunk_text": "Clinical description Primary hyperoxaluria type 3 (PH3) is characterized by recurring calcium oxalate stones beginning in childhood or adolescence and, on occasion, nephrocalcinosis or reduced kidney function. PH3 most often presents in childhood (median age 2 to 3 years) with signs or symptoms related to stones including hematuria, frequent urination, dysuria, blood visible in the urine, or stone-associated pain. Some individuals with PH3 do not present until adulthood, usually with stone-related symptoms or findings. Over time, frequent stones and/or nephrocalcinosis may compromise kidney function, resulting in chronic kidney disease. To date, systemic oxalosis has not been reported in PH3. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of PH3 is established in a proband with suggestive findings and biallelic pathogenic variants in HOGA1 identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: There is no cure for PH3. Lifelong treatment includes medical therapy and pharmacotherapy to reduce urine supersaturation of calcium oxalate to prevent formation of stones and calcium oxalate crystals that can injure the kidney. Mainstays of treatment are high oral fluid intake (>2.5 L per m2 body surface area) at all times; oral administration of an inhibitor of calcium oxalate crystallization, typically potassium and/or sodium citrate; prevention of stone complications by prompt relief of urinary tract obstruction and treatment of urinary tract infections. Surveillance: For those who are stable: (1) annual clinical assessment of stone-related symptoms (pain); frequency of passage of urinary stones and/or gravel and urinary tract infection; adherence to high fluid intake and medication schedule; and (2) annual assessment of kidney function (serum creatinine and eGFR), measurement of plasma oxalate concentration in those with impaired renal function, 24-hour urine oxalate and supersaturation study, and renal ultrasound examination or other imaging to monitor for stone formation.

GeneReviews More frequent assessments are required for: children under age four years, individuals with complex stone problems, and individuals with reduced kidney function. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Intravascular volume contraction, delays in treatment of acute stone episodes, nephrotoxic agents, high-dose ascorbic acid, and marked dietary oxalate excess. Evaluation of relatives at risk: Targeted molecular genetic testing for the familial HOGA1 pathogenic variants is recommended for all sibs of a proband (regardless of age and even if apparently asymptomatic) in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from early treatment, preventive measures, and knowledge of circumstances/agents to avoid. Pregnancy management: In the few reports available to date, pregnancy outcomes in women with PH3 appear to be similar to those in women with other genetic causes of hyperoxaluria. Nonetheless, pregnant women who have PH3 should be considered at higher risk and warrant close monitoring, given the increased risk of acute kidney injury due to hypovolemia and/or an obstructing or infected stone. Genetic counseling PH3 is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. If both parents are known to be heterozygous for a HOGA1 pathogenic variant, each sib of an affected individual has at conception a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier.

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Long-chain hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (LCHAD) deficiency and trifunctional protein (TFP) deficiency are caused by impairment of mitochondrial TFP. TFP has three enzymatic activities long-chain enoyl-CoA hydratase, long-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, and long-chain 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase. In individuals with LCHAD deficiency, there is isolated deficiency of long-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, while deficiency of all three enzymes occurs in individuals with TFP deficiency. Individuals with TFP deficiency can present with a severe-to-mild phenotype, while individuals with LCHAD deficiency typically present with a severe-to-intermediate phenotype. Neonates with the severe phenotype present within a few days of birth with hypoglycemia, hepatomegaly, encephalopathy, and often cardiomyopathy. The intermediate phenotype is characterized by hypoketotic hypoglycemia precipitated by infection or fasting in infancy. The mild (late-onset) phenotype is characterized by myopathy and/or neuropathy. Long-term complications include peripheral neuropathy and retinopathy. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of LCHAD/TFP deficiency is established in a proband with elevation of long-chain 3- hydroxyacylcarnitine species in plasma and/or increased excretion of 3-hydroxy-dicarboxylic acids in urine in combination with identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in HADHA or HADHB by molecular genetic testing.

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MADD) represents a clinical spectrum in which presentations can be divided into type I (neonatal onset with congenital anomalies), type II (neonatal onset without congenital anomalies), and type III (late onset). Individuals with type I or II MADD typically become symptomatic in the neonatal period with severe metabolic acidosis, which may be accompanied by profound hypoglycemia and hyperammonemia. Many affected individuals die in the newborn period despite metabolic treatment. In those who survive the neonatal period, recurrent metabolic decompensation resembling Reye syndrome and the development of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy can occur. Congenital anomalies may include dysmorphic facial features, large cystic kidneys, hypospadias and chordee in males, and neuronal migration defects (heterotopias) on brain MRI. Individuals with type III MADD, the most common presentation, can present from infancy to adulthood. The most common symptoms are muscle weakness, exercise intolerance, and/or muscle pain, although metabolic decompensation with episodes of rhabdomyolysis can also be seen. Rarely, individuals with late-onset MADD (type III) may develop severe sensory neuropathy in addition to proximal myopathy. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of MADD is established in a proband with elevation of several acylcarnitine species in blood in combination with increased excretion of multiple organic acids in urine and/or by identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in ETFA, ETFB, or ETFDH. Management Treatment of manifestations: Routine daily treatment includes limitation of protein and fat in the diet, avoidance of prolonged fasting, high-dose riboflavin (100-300 mg daily), carnitine supplementation (50-100 mg/kg daily in 3 divided doses) in those with carnitine deficiency, and coenzyme Q10 supplements (60-240 mg daily in 2 Author Affiliation: 1 Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York; Email: pankaj.prasun@mssm.edu.

Further treatments include feeding therapy with consideration of gastrostomy tube for those with failure to thrive, as well as standard treatment for developmental delay, cardiac dysfunction, and sensory neuropathy. Emergency outpatient treatment for mild decompensation includes decreasing the fasting interval, administration of antipyretics for fever, and antiemetics for vomiting. Acute treatment includes hospitalization with intravenous fluid containing at least 10% dextrose, and bicarbonate therapy depending on the metabolic status. Prevention of primary manifestations: Avoidance of fasting and supplementation with riboflavin, L-carnitine, and coenzyme Q10; a diet restricted in fat and protein is prescribed for some affected individuals based on the severity of the disorder. Prevention of secondary complications: Education of parents and caregivers such that diligent observation and management can be administered expediently in the setting of intercurrent illness or other catabolic stressors. Prompt initiation of dextrose containing intravenous fluids is essential to avoid complications such as liver failure, rhabdomyolysis, encephalopathy, and coma. Written protocols for emergency treatment should be provided to parents and primary care providers/pediatricians, and to teachers and school staff. Surveillance: Measurement of plasma free and total carnitine, acylcarnitine profile, serum creatine kinase (CK), urine organic acids, head circumference (in infants and children), and growth and developmental milestones at each visit; neuropsychological testing and standardized quality-of-life assessment tools for affected individuals and parents/caregivers as needed; EKG and echocardiogram annually for individuals with severe forms of MADD and less frequently for individuals with milder presentations. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Inadequate caloric provision during stressors (including following vaccination); prolonged fasting; dehydration; high-fat, high-protein diet; volatile anesthetics and those that contain high doses of long-chain fatty acids; administration of intravenous intralipids during an acute metabolic crisis. Evaluation of relatives at risk: Testing of all at-risk sibs of any age is warranted (targeted molecular genetic testing if the familial pathogenic variants are known in parallel with plasma acylcarnitine profile, plasma free and total carnitine, and urine organic acid assay) to allow for early diagnosis and treatment of MADD. Pregnancy management: Successful pregnancy with low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet in late-onset MADD has been published. There is no evidence to suggest that taking supplemental carnitine during pregnancy leads to adverse fetal effects. Riboflavin is a B vitamin and is considered an essential nutrient that is likely eliminated through feces and urine and does not result in excessive tissue absorption. Genetic counseling MADD is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. At conception, each sib of an affected individual has a 25% change of being affected, a 50% chance of being unaffected and a carrier, and a 25% change of being unaffected and not a carrier.

Management GeneReviews Treatment of manifestations: To date, there are no known cures and few effective treatments for any forms of mitochondrial disease, including the RRM2B-MDMDs. Treatment modalities focusing on symptomatic management and supportive care are best implemented by a multidisciplinary team. Surveillance: Because most infants and young children with the encephalomyopathic phenotype are severely affected and are hospitalized for prolonged periods, monitoring typically occurs regularly by senior clinical specialists. Individuals with the other phenotypes warrant routine monitoring based on their clinical findings, rate of disease progression, and response to interventions.

IGD is associated with a normal sense of smell (normosmic IGD) in approximately 40% of affected individuals and an impaired sense of smell (Kallmann syndrome) in approximately 60%. IGD can first become apparent in infancy, adolescence, or adulthood. Infant boys with congenital IGD often have micropenis and cryptorchidism. Adolescents and adults with IGD have clinical evidence of hypogonadism and incomplete sexual maturation on physical examination. Adult males with IGD tend to have prepubertal testicular volume (i.e., <4 mL), absence of secondary sexual features (e.g., facial and axillary hair growth, deepening of the voice), decreased muscle mass, diminished libido, erectile dysfunction, and infertility. Adult females have little or no breast development and primary amenorrhea. Although skeletal maturation is delayed, the rate of linear growth is usually normal except for the absence of a distinct pubertal growth spurt. Diagnosis/testing IGD is typically diagnosed in adolescents presenting with absent or partial puberty using biochemical testing that reveals low serum testosterone or estradiol (hypogonadism) that results from complete or partial absence of GnRH-mediated release of LH and FSH (hypogonadotropic hypogonadism [HH]) in the setting of otherwise normal anterior pituitary anatomy and function and in the absence of secondary causes of HH. Pathogenic variants in more than 25 genes account for about half of all IGD; the genetic cause for the remaining cases of IGD is unknown.

Management GeneReviews Treatment of manifestations: To induce and maintain secondary sex characteristics, gradually increasing doses of testosterone or human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) injections in males or estrogen and progestin in females; to stimulate spermatogenesis or folliculogenesis, either combined gonadotropin therapy (hCG and human menopausal gonadotropins [hMG] or recombinant FSH) or pulsatile GnRH therapy. If conception fails despite spermatogenesis in a male or ovulation induction in a female, in vitro fertilization may be an option. Prevention of secondary complications: Optimal calcium and vitamin D intake should be encouraged and specific treatment for decreased bone mass as needed. Surveillance: For children of both sexes with findings suggestive of IGD, monitor at regular intervals after age 11 years: sexual maturation (by Tanner staging on physical examination); gonadotropin and sex hormone levels; bone age. In individuals with confirmed IGD, monitor at regular intervals: serum sex steroid levels (to guide optimal hormone replacement); bone mineral density. Evaluation of relatives at risk: If the pathogenic variant(s) in a family are known, genetic testing of prepubertal at- risk relatives may be indicated to clarify their genetic status. Because of variable expressivity, a prepubertal child with a known pathogenic variant may progress through puberty in a normal or delayed fashion, or not at all; therefore, clinical reevaluation over time is necessary. Genetic counseling IGD can be inherited in an X-linked, autosomal dominant, or autosomal recessive manner. Almost all IGD- related genes have also been associated with indeterminate or oligogenic inheritance. Recurrence risk counseling is based on family history and the results of molecular genetic testing when available. Carrier testing for at-risk relatives in families with X-linked IGD or autosomal recessive IGD is possible if the pathogenic variant(s) in the family are known. Prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk is possible if the pathogenic variant(s) in the family are known."

The peak age of onset in LHON is in the second and third decades of life, with 90% of those who lose their vision doing so before age 50 years. Very rarely, individuals first manifest LHON in the seventh and eighth decades of life. Males are four to five times more likely to be affected than females, but neither sex nor mutational status significantly influences the timing and severity of the initial visual loss. Neurologic abnormalities such as postural tremor, peripheral neuropathy, nonspecific myopathy, and movement disorders have been reported to be more common in individuals with LHON than in the general population. Some individuals with LHON, usually women, may also develop a multiple sclerosis-like illness. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of LHON is established in a proband with a consistent clinical history and/or one of three common mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) pathogenic variants identified on molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Management of affected individuals remains mostly supportive, and includes provision of visual aids, occupational rehabilitation, and registration with the relevant social services. Idebenone (Raxone) has been approved for the treatment of LHON by the European Medicines Agency under exceptional circumstances. The current body of evidence indicates some visual benefit in a subgroup of affected individuals treated with idebenone, particularly those treated within the first year of onset of visual loss. Referral to a cardiologist for individuals with pre-excitation syndrome on EKG is recommended; treatment for symptomatic individuals is per standard practice.

GeneReviews A multidisciplinary approach for those affected individuals with extraocular neurologic features (ataxia, peripheral neuropathy, nonspecific myopathy, and movement disorders) should be considered to minimize the functional consequences of these complications. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Individuals in whom a LHON-causing mtDNA variant has been identified should be strongly advised not to smoke and to moderate alcohol intake, avoiding binge-drinking episodes. It would be reasonable to avoid exposure to other putative environmental triggers for visual loss, such as head trauma, industrial toxins, and drugs with mitochondrial toxic effects. Genetic counseling LHON is caused by pathogenic variants in mtDNA and is transmitted strictly by maternal inheritance. The mother of a proband usually has the mtDNA pathogenic variant and may or may not have developed visual loss. A male (affected or unaffected) with a primary LHON-causing mtDNA pathogenic variant cannot transmit the variant to any of his offspring. A female (affected or unaffected) with a primary LHON-causing mtDNA variant transmits the variant to all of her offspring. In approximately 60% of families, a history of visual loss affecting maternal relatives is present. Genetic counseling for LHON is complicated by the sex- and age-dependent penetrance of the primary mtDNA LHON-causing pathogenic variants and penetrance can vary markedly in different branches of the same family and between families harboring the same LHON-causing mtDNA pathogenic variant. Once a mtDNA LHON-causing variant in the mother has been identified, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible; however, accurate interpretation of a positive prenatal test result is difficult because the mtDNA mutational load in amniocytes and chorionic villi may not correspond to that of other fetal or adult tissues, and the presence of the mtDNA LHON- causing variant does not predict the occurrence, age of onset, severity, or rate of progression of visual loss."

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics RPE65-related Leber congenital amaurosis / early-onset severe retinal dystrophy (RPE65-LCA/EOSRD) is a severe inherited retinal degeneration (IRD) with a typical presentation between birth and age five years. While central vision varies, the hallmark of this disorder is the presence of severe visual impairment with a deceptively preserved retinal structure. Vision is relatively stable in the first decade of life, but begins to decline in adolescence. Most affected individuals are legally blind (visual acuity 20/200 and/or visual fields extending <20 degrees from fixation) by age 20 years. After age 20 years, visual acuity declines further and by the fourth decade all affected individuals are legally blind and many have complete loss of vision (i.e., no light perception). Milder disease phenotypes have been described in individuals with hypomorphic alleles. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of RPE65-LCA/EOSRD is established in a proband with suggestive findings and biallelic pathogenic variants in RPE65 identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Individuals with any type of inherited retinal dystrophy are advised to eat a healthy balanced diet to reach the minimum Reference Daily Intake (RDI) for nutrients, as recommended by the USDA. Due to poor night vision, patients are advised to use a flashlight for illumination. Children with RPE65-LCA/ EOSRD are usually of normal intellect but may experience learning difficulties and/or psychiatric/behavioral issues as a result of their visual impairment. Those with learning disabilities will benefit from referral to a developmental pediatrician for consideration of enrollment in a continuing program of care and support.

Surveillance: Follow up at regular intervals of ophthalmologic manifestations, developmental/educational needs, psychiatric/behavioral issues, and family support/resource needs. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Although not typically seen in RPE65-IRDs, repeatedly poking and pressing on the eyes should be discouraged as it may cause damage to the cornea and/or retina. Evaluation of relatives at risk: It is appropriate to clarify the genetic status of sibs of an individual with RPE65- LCA/EOSRD in order to identify those who may benefit from gene replacement therapy or other treatments. Therapies under investigation: Clinical investigations of variations of the FDA-approved gene replacement therapy are underway. Oral retinoid supplementation is also being investigated as a possible therapy. Genetic counseling RPE65-LCA/EOSRD is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. At conception, each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Once the RPE65 pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member, carrier testing for at-risk relatives, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk, and preimplantation genetic testing are possible."

Age at onset is usually between 50 and 64 years (range: 20-91 years) irrespective of the presenting manifestations, which may be pure FTD, pure amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), or a combination of the two phenotypes. The clinical presentation is highly heterogeneous and may differ between and within families, causing an unpredictable pattern and age of onset of clinical manifestations.

In this GeneReview, C9orf72 frontotemporal dementia and/or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (C9orf72-FTD/ALS) refers to the spectrum of phenotypes caused by C9orf72 G4C2 pathogenic repeat expansions, also sometimes referred to as the C9orf72 FTD/ALS complex. Suggestive Findings C9orf72-FTD/ALS should be suspected in probands with the following clinical and neuroimaging findings and family history [Van Mossevelde et al 2018, Cammack et al 2019, Moore et al 2020]. Clinical Findings Age at onset ranges from 20 to 91 years, with a mean of 58 8-10 years [Van Mossevelde et al 2017a]. Neurologic findings (See also Table 1.) Frontotemporal dementia (FTD), the most common clinical presentation, is characterized by progressive behavioral impairment, decline in executive function, and/or language impairment (see Table 1). Of the three FTD clinical syndromes, behavioral variant FTD (bvFTD) is more often present than the two language variants (collectively identified as primary progressive aphasia [PPA]: semantic variant PPA [svPPA] and non-fluent variant PPA [nfvPPA]).

    "chunk_text": "Clinical characteristics Phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthetase (PRS) superactivity comprises two phenotypes, both characterized by hyperuricemia and hyperuricosuria. The mild phenotype (~75% of affected males) with onset in the second or third decade of life is typically limited to these biochemical findings, whereas the severe phenotype (~25% of affected males) with onset in the first decade of life has in addition to these biochemical findings variable combinations of developmental delay (DD) / intellectual disability (ID), sensorineural hearing loss, hypotonia, and ataxia. In the mild phenotype, uric acid crystalluria or a urinary stone is commonly the first clinical finding, followed later by gouty arthritis if serum urate concentration is not controlled. Diagnosis/testing In male probands with the mild phenotype, detection of high activity or lack of allosteric regulation of the PRS-I enzyme (PRS-I enzyme assay) establishes the diagnosis. Molecular genetic testing of PRPS1 fails to detect a hemizygous pathogenic variant. In male probands with the severe phenotype, molecular genetic testing establishes the diagnosis by identification of a hemizygous PRPS1 pathogenic variant in males and a heterozygous PRPS1 pathogenic variant in females. In symptomatic female probands, PRS-I enzyme assay and/or PRPS1 molecular genetic testing establishes the diagnosis. Management Treatment of manifestations: In all individuals, hyperuricemia and hyperuricosuria can be reduced by treatment with allopurinol or febuxostat to reduce uric acid formation and thus serum urate and urinary uric acid; high daily fluid intake; and, as needed, potassium citrate to alkalinize the urine.

Surveillance: All individuals: monthly measurement of 24-hour urinary uric acid excretion or a spot urinary urate-to-creatinine ratio helps in assessing the response to treatment; once a normal serum urate concentration is achieved, serum urate concentration should be monitored at a minimum annually to assure that target urate concentration is maintained; a 24-hour urine should be monitored at least annually for urate and xanthine particularly to ensure that urinary xanthine does not exceed solubility (<1 mmol/L). In the severe phenotype: monitor development / educational needs, neurologic manifestations, and hearing. Agents/circumstances to minimize or avoid: In all individuals: high-purine meats (i.e., red and organ meats), shellfish, oily fish (e.g., anchovies, sardines), beer, high-fructose corn syrup-containing beverages and foods, dehydration, and if possible, urate-retaining medications (e.g., low-dose aspirin, thiazide diuretics). Evaluation of relatives at risk: It is appropriate to screen apparently asymptomatic older and younger at-risk relatives of an individual with PRS superactivity in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from initiation of treatment and preventive measures for hyperuricemia and hyperuricosuria. Evaluations include: In male and female relatives: molecular genetic testing if a PRPS1 pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member; In male relatives at risk: measurement of serum urate concentration and 24-hour urinary uric acid excretion or spot urinary urate-to-creatinine ratio. Note: Biochemical testing is unlikely to be informative in asymptomatic females. Genetic counseling PRS superactivity caused by a pathogenic variant in PRPS1 is inherited in an X-linked manner. Females who are heterozygous for a PRPS1 pathogenic variant have a 50% chance of transmitting the pathogenic variant in each pregnancy: males who inherit the pathogenic variant will be severely affected; females who inherit the pathogenic variant will be heterozygous and may be asymptomatic or have a range of features. Males with a PRPS1 pathogenic variant transmit the pathogenic variant to all of their daughters and none of their sons. If a PRPS1 pathogenic variant has been identified in the proband, heterozygote testing for at-risk female relatives, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk, and preimplantation genetic testing are possible. PRS superactivity caused by elevated PRPS1 mRNA levels is also inherited in an X-linked manner; however, because the underlying genetic alteration has not been characterized, the mode of inheritance cannot be confirmed with certainty."

Cardiomyopathy, which is almost always present before age five years, is typically dilated cardiomyopathy with or without endocardial fibroelastosis or left ventricular noncompaction; hypertrophic cardiomyopathy can also occur. Heart failure is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality; risk of arrhythmia and sudden death is increased. Neutropenia is most often associated with mouth ulcers, pneumonia, and sepsis. The nonprogressive myopathy predominantly affects the proximal muscles, and results in early motor delays. Prepubertal growth delay is followed by a postpubertal growth spurt with remarkable \\\"catch-up\\\" growth. Heterozygous females who have a normal karyotype are asymptomatic and have normal biochemical studies.

Clinical characteristics Leukodystrophies are heritable myelin disorders affecting the white matter of the central nervous system with or without peripheral nervous system myelin involvement. Involvement of the white matter tracts almost universally leads to motor involvement that manifests as hypotonia in early childhood and progresses to spasticity over time. This may lead to variable motor impairment, from mild spastic diplegia to severe spastic quadriplegia that limits purposeful movement. In addition, motor dysfunction is likely to significantly impair vital functions including swallowing, chewing, and (in some cases) respiration. Other findings that vary by disorder include extrapyramidal movement disorders (e.g., dystonia and/or dyskinesias), ataxia, seizures, and delay in cognitive development or change in cognitive function over time. Diagnosis/testing Establishing the specific leukodystrophy present in a given individual usually involves: Obtaining a medical history and detailed family history Performing a physical examination and neurologic examination Review of brain MRI findings: T2-weighted hyperintensity in the white matter is the MRI finding required for diagnosis of a leukodystrophy.

GeneReviews T1-weighted signal may be variable: iso- or hyperintense T1-weighted signal is consistent with a hypomyelinating leukodystrophy; hypointense T1-weighted signal is consistent with a demyelinating leukodystrophy. Performing specialized laboratory testing, often including molecular genetic testing (either stepwise single-gene testing or use of a multigene panel targeted to the leukodystrophies). Genetic counseling Leukodystrophies with an identified genetic cause may be inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, an autosomal recessive manner, or an X-linked recessive manner. Genetic counseling regarding risk to family members depends on accurate diagnosis, determination of the mode of inheritance in each family, and results of molecular genetic testing. Prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk is possible for some types of leukodystrophy if the pathogenic variant(s) in the family are known. Many leukodystrophies are still without an identified genetic cause; once a genetic cause is identified, other inheritance patterns may emerge. Management Treatment of manifestations: Treatment is symptomatic and ideally occurs in a multidisciplinary setting by specialists experienced in the care of persons with a leukodystrophy. Pharmacologic agents are used to manage muscle tone and block neuronal signaling to muscle (chemodenervation). Intensive physical therapy is used to improve mobility and function. Pharmacologic treatment of dystonia and dyskinesias may result in significant functional improvement. Treatment of ataxia, seizures, and cognitive issues is provided in the usual manner, depending on the needs of the individual. Prevention of primary manifestations: In a few leukodystrophies primary disease manifestations can be prevented by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) or bone marrow transplantation (BMT) early in the disease course. Surveillance: Routine assessment of growth and nutritional status; physical examination and/or serial x-rays of the hips and spine to monitor for orthopedic complications; and routine history regarding signs and symptoms of seizures. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Mild head injuries and infection as these may exacerbate disease manifestations. Evaluation of relatives at risk: When primary prevention of a leukodystrophy is possible (e.g., by HSCT or BMT), it is appropriate to offer testing to asymptomatic at-risk relatives who would benefit from early diagnosis and consideration of early treatment."

    "chunk_text": "NOTE: THIS PUBLICATION HAS BEEN RETIRED. THIS ARCHIVAL VERSION IS FOR HISTORICAL REFERENCE ONLY, AND THE INFORMATION MAY BE OUT OF DATE. Clinical characteristics Congenital muscular dystrophy (CMD) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of inherited muscle disorders. Muscle weakness typically presents from birth to early infancy. Affected infants typically appear \\\"floppy\\\" with low muscle tone and poor spontaneous movements. Affected children may present with delay or arrest of gross motor development together with joint and/or spinal rigidity. Muscle weakness may improve, worsen, or stabilize in the short term; however, with time progressive weakness and joint contractures, spinal deformities, and respiratory compromise may affect quality of life and life span. The main CMD subtypes, grouped by involved protein function and gene in which causative allelic variants occur, are laminin alpha-2 (merosin) deficiency (MDC1A), collagen VI-deficient CMD, the dystroglycanopathies (caused by mutation of POMT1, POMT2, FKTN, FKRP, LARGE1, POMGNT1, and ISPD), SELENON (SEPN1)-related CMD (previously known as rigid spine syndrome, RSMD1) and LMNA-related CMD (L-CMD). Several less known CMD subtypes have been reported in a limited number of individuals. Cognitive impairment ranging from intellectual disability to mild cognitive delay, structural brain and/or eye abnormalities, and seizures are found almost exclusively in the dystroglycanopathies while white matter abnormalities without major cognitive involvement tend to be seen in the laminin alpha-2-deficient subtype.

Diagnosis/testing GeneReviews The diagnosis of congenital muscular dystrophy relies on clinical findings, brain and muscle imaging, muscle biopsy histology (dystrophic features without the hallmarks of the structural changes seen in the congenital myopathies), muscle and/or skin immunohistochemical staining, and molecular genetic testing. Genetic counseling The congenital muscular dystrophies are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner with the following exceptions: collagen VI-deficient CMD, which may be inherited in an autosomal recessive or an autosomal dominant manner; LMNA-related CMD (L-CMD), which is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner with all cases to date caused by a de novo pathogenic variant. In autosomal recessive subtypes, each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Carriers are asymptomatic. Carrier testing for at-risk relatives and prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk are possible if the pathogenic variants in the family are known. In autosomal dominant subtypes, the offspring of affected individuals have a 50% chance of being affected. The risk to sibs of an individual with an apparent de novo pathogenic variant is low, but not zero because of the possibility of germline mosaicism in one of the parents. Prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk is possible for families in which the pathogenic variant has been identified. Management Treatment of manifestations: Treatment tailored to an individuals needs is best managed by a multidisciplinary team. Speech therapy and swallowing studies are used to evaluate those with feeding difficulties and/or possible aspiration. Interventions may be needed for inadequate weight gain and poor feeding. Aspiration pneumonia and/or respiratory insufficiency may require assisted cough devices, supplemental oxygen, noninvasive ventilation, and/or mechanical ventilation via tracheostomy. Physical therapy focuses on stretching exercises of the spine and limbs and to prevent contractures, and positive pressure devices or ventilation to promote mobility of the thoracic cage. Splints, braces and surgical intervention are used to prevent and treat spinal and limb contractures and deformities; these and other assistive devices may help posture, ambulation, and mobility. Epilepsy, behavior problems, and/or intellectual disability require specific treatment and interventions. Vaccinations, early treatment of pulmonary infections, and attention to oral hygiene and care are important aspects of routine care. With support for their physical disabilities the vast majority of children with CMD who have normal cognitive development benefit socially and educationally from mainstreaming into regular educational facilities. The multidisciplinary team can provide social and emotional support for patients and caregivers. Surveillance: Routine monitoring of feeding and weight gain, respiratory function, strength, and mobility; annual or biannual monitoring for orthopedic and pulmonary complications; cardiac monitoring for those with CMD subtypes involving a risk for cardiomyopathy. Those with CMD subtypes with central nervous system involvement require surveillance for possible seizures and/or behavioral problems."

Clinical characteristics Microphthalmia, anophthalmia, and coloboma comprise the MAC spectrum of ocular malformations. Microphthalmia refers to a globe with a total axial length that is at least two standard deviations below the mean for age. Anophthalmia refers to complete absence of the globe in the presence of ocular adnexa (eyelids, conjunctiva, and lacrimal apparatus). Coloboma refers to the ocular malformations that result from failure of closure of the optic fissure. Chorioretinal coloboma refers to coloboma of the retina and choroid. Iris coloboma causes the iris to appear keyhole-shaped. Microphthalmia, anophthalmia, and coloboma may be unilateral or bilateral; when bilateral they may occur in any combination. Diagnosis/testing Molecular genetic testing (which can include sequence analysis, gene-targeted deletion/duplication analysis, and chromosome microarray analysis [CMA]) can identify a genetic cause in 80% of individuals with bilateral anophthalmia/severe microphthalmia and in up to 20% of all individuals with an ocular malformation in the MAC spectrum.

Genetic counseling GeneReviews When an inherited or de novo chromosome abnormality or a specific syndrome is identified either by phenotypic findings or by genetic/genomic testing, genetic counseling is indicated based on the mode of inheritance for that condition. Management Treatment of MAC spectrum: Prosthetic intervention is appropriate for those with severe microphthalmia and anophthalmia. In many infants, an ocularist can start shortly after birth to expand the palpebral fissures, conjunctival cul-de-sac, and orbit using conformers of progressively increasing size. An oculoplastic surgeon can help determine the most suitable options for surgical intervention after age six months (when postnatal growth of the orbit can be assessed) and before the age that orbital dimensions are fixed (after which extensive orbital reconstruction may be required). Children with reduced vision may benefit from visual aids and other visual resources as well as early intervention to help optimize psychomotor development, educational endeavors, life skills, and mobility. Protection of the healthy eye in those with unilateral involvement is recommended."

    "chunk_text": "NOTE: THIS PUBLICATION HAS BEEN RETIRED. THIS ARCHIVAL VERSION IS FOR HISTORICAL REFERENCE ONLY, AND THE INFORMATION MAY BE OUT OF DATE. Clinical characteristics Congenital hepatic fibrosis (CHF) is a developmental disorder of the portobiliary system characterized histologically by defective remodeling of the ductal plate (ductal plate malformation; DPM), abnormal branching of the intrahepatic portal veins, and progressive fibrosis of the portal tracts. CHF may or may not be associated with macroscopic cystic dilatation of the intrahepatic bile ducts. Clinical findings include enlarged, abnormally shaped liver, relatively well-preserved hepatocellular function, and portal hypertension (PH) resulting in splenomegaly, hypersplenism, and gastroesophageal varices. Pulmonary hypertension (portopulmonary hypertension) and vascular shunts in the pulmonary parenchyma (hepatopulmonary syndrome), complications of PH, can also be seen rarely. Most frequently CHF is associated with ciliopathies (disorders of the primary cilia) that have associated renal disease, the so-called hepatorenal fibrocystic diseases (FCDs). Although the hepatorenal FCDs are currently classified by phenotype, it is likely that gene-based classification will be quite different in the future because of the tremendous genetic and phenotypic overlap between these disorders. Diagnosis/testing CHF is typically diagnosed by finding increased echogenicity of the liver parenchyma with or without macrocysts on ultrasound examination; MRI including magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) Author Affiliations: 1 National Human Genome Research Institute, Medical Genetics Branch, Section on Human Biochemical Genetics, Intramural Office of Rare Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland; Email: mgaygun@mail.nih.gov. 2 Associate Professor of Pediatrics and Genetics, Institute of Genetic Medicine, Departments of Pediatrics and Genetics, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland; Email: mgaygun@mail.nih.gov. 3 Clinical Director, National Human Genome Research Institute, Medical Genetics Branch, Section on Human Biochemical Genetics, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland; Email: bgahl@helix.nih.gov. 4 Investigator, Liver Disease Branch, National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland; Email: theller@nih.gov.

Liver biopsy is rarely required. The multisystem syndromes associated with hepatorenal FCDs are diagnosed by physical examination or other specialized studies, family history, and molecular genetic testing. Genetic counseling The syndromes associated with CHF are most commonly inherited in an autosomal recessive manner; however, X-linked and autosomal dominant inheritance are also observed. Genetic counseling depends on accurate determination of the specific genetic diagnosis. Management Treatment of manifestations: No therapies can repair the primary ductal plate malformation or reverse the fibrosis or biliary tree abnormalities. Complications of CHF, including variceal bleeding, hypersplenism, cholangitis, and, to a lesser extent, biliary stones, cholangiocarcinoma, and hepatocellular carcinoma, are treated in a routine manner. Prevention of secondary complications: Immunization for hepatitis A and B. Surveillance: Monitor growth rate in children; screen for gastroesophageal varices and hepatopulmonary syndrome when the platelet count decreases significantly over time or prior to interventions such as renal transplantation. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Alcohol, obesity, diabetes mellitus, malnutrition, infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), immunosuppression, hepatotoxic medicines, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in those with varices because of the increased risk of bleeding, contact sports/activities in those with splenomegaly because of the increased risk of splenic injury."

Clinical characteristics Hirschsprung disease (HSCR), or congenital intestinal aganglionosis, is a birth defect characterized by complete absence of neuronal ganglion cells from a portion of the intestinal tract. The aganglionic segment includes the distal rectum and a variable length of contiguous proximal intestine. In 80% of individuals, aganglionosis is restricted to the rectosigmoid colon (short-segment disease); in 15%-20%, aganglionosis extends proximal to the sigmoid colon (long-segment disease); in about 5%, aganglionosis affects the entire large intestine (total colonic aganglionosis). Rarely, the aganglionosis extends into the small bowel or even more proximally to encompass the entire bowel (total intestinal aganglionosis). HSCR is considered a neurocristopathy, a disorder of cells and tissues derived from the neural crest, and may occur as an isolated finding or as part of a multisystem disorder. Affected infants frequently present in the first two months of life with symptoms of impaired intestinal motility such as failure to pass meconium within the first 48 hours of life, constipation, emesis, abdominal pain or distention, and occasionally diarrhea. However, because the initial diagnosis of HSCR may be delayed until late childhood or adulthood, HSCR should be considered in anyone with lifelong severe constipation. Individuals with HSCR are at risk for enterocolitis and/or potentially lethal intestinal perforation. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of HSCR requires histopathologic demonstration of absence of enteric ganglion cells in the distal rectum. Suction biopsies of rectal mucosa and submucosa are the preferred diagnostic test in most centers because they can be performed safely without general anesthesia. Syndromes associated with HSCR are diagnosed by clinical findings, cytogenetic analysis, or in some cases, by specific molecular or biochemical tests.

GeneReviews Isolated HSCR (i.e., HSCR in the absence of related systemic findings) is a disorder associated with pathogenic variants in a number of genes. Genetic counseling Recurrence risk depends on the underlying cause. Management Treatment of manifestations: Resection of the aganglionic segment and anastomosis of proximal bowel to the anus (\\\"pull-through\\\") is the standard treatment for HSCR. Individuals with extensive intestinal aganglionosis who develop irreversible intestinal failure may be candidates for intestinal transplantation."

    "chunk_text": "NOTE: THIS PUBLICATION HAS BEEN RETIRED. THIS ARCHIVAL VERSION IS FOR HISTORICAL REFERENCE ONLY, AND THE INFORMATION MAY BE OUT OF DATE. Clinical characteristics Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) is a purely descriptive term, generally reserved for childhood- or adult-onset muscular dystrophies that are distinct from the much more common X-linked dystrophinopathies. LGMDs are typically nonsyndromic, with clinical involvement typically limited to skeletal muscle. Individuals with LGMD generally show weakness and wasting restricted to the limb musculature, proximal greater than distal, and muscle degeneration/regeneration on muscle biopsy. Most individuals with LGMD show relative sparing of the bulbar muscles, although exceptions occur, depending on the genetic subtype. Onset, progression, and distribution of the weakness and wasting vary considerably among individuals and genetic subtypes. Diagnosis/testing The limb-girdle muscular dystrophies typically show degeneration/regeneration (dystrophic changes) on muscle biopsy, which is usually associated with elevated serum creatine kinase concentration. For any male or female suspected of having limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, it is necessary to first rule out an X-linked dystrophinopathy. Biochemical testing (i.e., protein testing by immunostaining or immunblotting) performed on a muscle biopsy can establish the diagnosis of the following LGMD types: sarcoglycanopathy, calpainopathy, dysferlinopathy, and O-linked glycosylation defects (also known as dystroglycanopathy). In some cases, demonstration of complete or partial deficiencies for any particular protein can then be followed by mutation studies of the corresponding gene. Pathogenic variants in a number of genes have been associated with types of LGMD.

Genetic counseling GeneReviews The term LGMD1 (including, e.g., LGMD1A, LGMD1B) refers to genetic types showing dominant inheritance, whereas LGMD2 refers to types with autosomal recessive inheritance. Pathogenic variants at more than 50 loci have been reported, making accurate diagnosis and genetic counseling a challenge. In most instances, the proband represents a simplex case, and the families can be counseled for recurrence risks associated with rare autosomal recessive conditions, which leaves a \\\"significant\\\" risk only for the sibs of the proband. If the causative pathogenic variant(s) have been identified in the family, prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk is possible. Management No definitive treatments for the limb-girdle muscular dystrophies exist. Management should be tailored as much as possible to each individual and each specific LGMD type. Management to prolong survival and improve quality of life includes weight control to avoid obesity, physical therapy and stretching exercises to promote mobility and prevent contractures, use of mechanical aids to help ambulation and mobility, surgical intervention for orthopedic complications, use of respiratory aids when indicated, monitoring for cardiomyopathy in LGMD types with cardiac involvement, and social and emotional support and stimulation."

Clinical characteristics Craniofacial microsomia (CFM) includes a spectrum of malformations primarily involving structures derived from the first and second branchial arches. Characteristic findings include facial asymmetry resulting from maxillary and/or mandibular hypoplasia; preauricular or facial tags; ear malformations that can include microtia (hypoplasia of the external ear), anotia (absence of the external ear), or aural atresia (absence of the external ear canal); and hearing loss. Severity can range from subtle facial asymmetry with a small skin tag in front of an otherwise normal-appearing ear to bilateral involvement (typically asymmetric), microtia/anotia with atresia of the ear canals, microphthalmia, and respiratory compromise from severe mandibular hypoplasia. Other craniofacial malformations including cleft lip and/or palate can be seen. Non-craniofacial malformations, especially vertebral, renal, cardiac, and limb, can be seen. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of CFM is based on clinical findings. Genetic counseling CFM most frequently occurs as a simplex case (i.e., occurrence in a single individual in a family) with unknown etiology; recurrence risks are empiric. If an individual with CFM is found to have an inherited or de novo chromosome abnormality, genetic counseling for that condition is indicated.

Management Treatment of manifestations: For optimal outcome children with CFM require timely and coordinated assessments and interventions. Ideally, children should be managed by an experienced multidisciplinary craniofacial team. The goals of treatment for CFM are to assure adequate respiratory support and feeding in infants with severe facial malformations, maximize hearing and communication, improve facial symmetry, and optimize dental occlusion. Treatment is age-dependent, with time-sensitive interventions at appropriate stages of craniofacial growth and development."
